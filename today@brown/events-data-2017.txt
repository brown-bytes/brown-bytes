Chemistry Colloquium Prof Christine M Thomas Brandeis University Host Jerome Robinson New Frontiers in MetalMetal Bonding and Reactivity of EarlyLate Heterobimetallic ComplexesOur group has been using bridging phosphinoamide ligands to investigate earlylate heterobimetallic complexes The metalmetal interactions in these compounds provide a unique method for tuning redox potentials and promoting  bond activation processes In an early example of this phenomenon a representative trisphosphinoamidesupported ZrCo complex was shown to undergo twoelectron reduction at a potential 1 V more positive than a monometallic Co trisphosphine analogue Once reduced by two electrons the resulting coordinatively unsaturated ZrCo complexes have been shown to undergo one two and fourelectron transfer processes activating a wide variety of  bonds eg OH NH CX and  bonds eg the CO bond in CO2 The reactivity of ZrCo heterobimetallic complexes has been applied to several catalytic processes including Kumada crosscoupling and the hydrosilylation of ketones and aldehydes and it has been demonstrated that both metal centers play a crucial role in catalysis A series of heterobimetallic compounds has been synthesized uncovering metalmetal multiple bonds across a variety of different metalmetal combinations More recently the phosphinoamide ligand framework has also been used to explore homo and heterobimetallic complexes featuring interactions between two late transition metal centers differentiated by their coordination environment rather than their position on the periodic table
