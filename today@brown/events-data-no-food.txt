 For centuries the sale and enslavement of men and women of African descent fueled a global economy The system of racial slavery relied upon ideas of racial difference that regulated social norms and conceptions of humanity and beauty The continued dominance of whiteness formed during this social system continues to devalue Black life and dehumanize men and women of African descent As well Black womens experiences are often left out of histories of slavery their contributions at the forefront of social movements forgotten The work of Heimark Artist in Residence Jessica Hill examines the resilience of black womanhood today Her pieces explore the ways in which racial slavery created ideas about race and racial difference that continue to divide our society Her work references folktales created through the middle passage and the communities which enslaved people formed in the New World She creates intricate and beautiful patterns drawing from African symbols and design as well as the African American quilting tradition Using iconic references and images of slavery and resistance such as the whip the plantation chains and raised fists she visualizes the ways in which Black women have always fought various forms of incarceration seeking freedom for themselves and future generations By asking the viewer to reimagine familiar symbols the work of Jess Hill seeks to erode historical constructs which continue to dominate American society Herstory Works by Jessica Hill

 Scientific Computing Seminar Friday February am Room Hope Street Ricardo Cortez Tulane University Title Computational models of elastic filaments in a viscous fluid with biological applications Abstract Many interesting biological phenomena involve thin flexible filaments interacting with a fluid Some examples are the motion of microorganisms through the actuation of flagella the coordinated motion of cilia and the swimming of spermatozoa I will present computational models of microscopic filaments in a fluid based on the method of regularized Stokeslets and some of its variations including a recently developed method for linear forces on line segments Examples will include simulations of sperm motility that aim to understand the effect of asymmetry in the flagellar beat patterns as well as interactions with a nearby surface which is important in fertilization Effects of elastic polymers immersed in the fluid are incorporated through a network of crosslinked nodes where each link is modeled by a simple viscoelastic element If time allows I will also present ongoing work with passive fibers in shear flows Scientific Computing Seminar presents Ricardo Cortez Tulane University

 Michael S Goodman Memorial Seminar Series Speaker Ellie Pavlick Brown University Title Why should NLP care about linguistics Abstract In just the past few months a flurry of adversarial studies have pushed back on the apparent progress of neural networks with multiple analyses suggesting that deep models of text fail to capture even basic properties of language such as negation word order and compositionality Alongside this wave of negative results our field has stated ambitions to move beyond taskspecific models and toward general purpose word sentence and even document embeddings This is a tall order for the field of NLP and I argue marks a significant shift in the way we approach our research I will discuss what we can learn from the field of linguistics about the challenges of codifying all of language in a general purpose way Then more importantly I will discuss what we cannot learn from linguistics I will argue that the stateoftheart of NLP research is operating close to the limits of what we know about natural language semantics both within our field and outside it I will conclude with thoughts on why this opens opportunities for NLP to advance both technology and basic science as it relates to language and the implications for the way we should conduct empirical research LingLangLunch Ellie Pavlick Brown University

 Special Talk Data Science Initiative Thursday February pm Room Hope Street Grant Rotskoff New York University Title Neural networks as interacting particle systems understanding global convergence of parameter optimization dynamics Abstract The performance of neural networks on highdimensional data distributions suggests that it may be possible to parameterize a representation of a target highdimensional function with controllably small errors potentially outperforming standard interpolation methods We demonstrate both theoretically and numerically that this is indeed the case We map the parameters of a neural network to a system of particles relaxing with an interaction potential determined by the loss function This mapping gives rise to a deterministic partial differential equation that governs the parameter evolution under gradient descent dynamics We also show that in the limit that the number of parameters n is large the landscape of the meansquared error becomes convex and the representation error in the function scales link n In this limit we prove a dynamical variant of the universal approximation theorem showing that the optimal representation can be attained by stochastic gradient descent the algorithm ubiquitously used for parameter optimization in machine learning This conceptual framework can be leveraged to develop algorithms that accelerate optimization using nonlocal transport I will conclude by showing that using neuron birthdeath processes in parameter optimization guarantees global convergence and provides a substantial acceleration in practice Special Data Science Initiative Talk Grant Rotskoff New York University

 PDE Seminar Friday February pm Room Hope Street Nestor Guillen University of Massachusetts at Amherst Title Recent results on Generated Jacobian Equationas A large number of problems involve mappings with a prescribed Jacobian from optimal transport mappings to problems of lenses and antenna design in geometric optics Many of these problems originate from what is now known as a generating function eg the cost function in optimal transport in which case the equation is known as Generated Jacobian Equation This class of equations has been proposed by Trudinger and it covers not only optimal transport problems but also nearfield problems in optics In this talk I will discuss work with Jun Kitagawa were we prove Holder continuity for the gradient of weak solutions to GJE under natural assumptions The results are in the spirit of and extend Caffarellis theory for the real MongeAmpere equation The key observation is that a quasiconvexity property of the underlying generating function related to MTW tensor guarantees the validity of an estimate akin to Aleksandrovs estimate for convex functions PDE Seminar Presents Nestor Guillen University of Massachusetts at Amherst

Ends of the House: Deconstructing the Dream in the Late Industrial Urban Midwest will be presented by Catherine Fennell, an associate professor of anthropology at Columbia University. This anthropological paper focuses on the burgeoning house deconstruction movement in the late industrial urban Midwest. Through this case, it maps an emerging ethos of collective life predicated upon embracing, rather than denying or resenting intense forms of ecological and economic degradation. Fennells work focuses on the decline and transformation of a key infrastructure of the 20th century US welfare state -- subsidized housing. She interrogates how the material and social legacies of such housing shape the politics of difference, collective care and obligation, and utopian imagination in the urban Midwest. Part of the Development and Governance Seminar series.
