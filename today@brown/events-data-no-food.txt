 For centuries the sale and enslavement of men and women of African descent fueled a global economy The system of racial slavery relied upon ideas of racial difference that regulated social norms and conceptions of humanity and beauty The continued dominance of whiteness formed during this social system continues to devalue Black life and dehumanize men and women of African descent As well Black womens experiences are often left out of histories of slavery their contributions at the forefront of social movements forgotten The work of Heimark Artist in Residence Jessica Hill examines the resilience of black womanhood today Her pieces explore the ways in which racial slavery created ideas about race and racial difference that continue to divide our society Her work references folktales created through the middle passage and the communities which enslaved people formed in the New World She creates intricate and beautiful patterns drawing from African symbols and design as well as the African American quilting tradition Using iconic references and images of slavery and resistance such as the whip the plantation chains and raised fists she visualizes the ways in which Black women have always fought various forms of incarceration seeking freedom for themselves and future generations By asking the viewer to reimagine familiar symbols the work of Jess Hill seeks to erode historical constructs which continue to dominate American society Herstory Works by Jessica Hill

 Michael S Goodman Memorial Seminar Series Speaker Ellie Pavlick Brown University Title Why should NLP care about linguistics Abstract In just the past few months a flurry of adversarial studies have pushed back on the apparent progress of neural networks with multiple analyses suggesting that deep models of text fail to capture even basic properties of language such as negation word order and compositionality Alongside this wave of negative results our field has stated ambitions to move beyond taskspecific models and toward general purpose word sentence and even document embeddings This is a tall order for the field of NLP and I argue marks a significant shift in the way we approach our research I will discuss what we can learn from the field of linguistics about the challenges of codifying all of language in a general purpose way Then more importantly I will discuss what we cannot learn from linguistics I will argue that the stateoftheart of NLP research is operating close to the limits of what we know about natural language semantics both within our field and outside it I will conclude with thoughts on why this opens opportunities for NLP to advance both technology and basic science as it relates to language and the implications for the way we should conduct empirical research LingLangLunch Ellie Pavlick Brown University

 Special Talk Data Science Initiative Thursday February pm Room Hope Street Grant Rotskoff New York University Title Neural networks as interacting particle systems understanding global convergence of parameter optimization dynamics Abstract The performance of neural networks on highdimensional data distributions suggests that it may be possible to parameterize a representation of a target highdimensional function with controllably small errors potentially outperforming standard interpolation methods We demonstrate both theoretically and numerically that this is indeed the case We map the parameters of a neural network to a system of particles relaxing with an interaction potential determined by the loss function This mapping gives rise to a deterministic partial differential equation that governs the parameter evolution under gradient descent dynamics We also show that in the limit that the number of parameters n is large the landscape of the meansquared error becomes convex and the representation error in the function scales link n In this limit we prove a dynamical variant of the universal approximation theorem showing that the optimal representation can be attained by stochastic gradient descent the algorithm ubiquitously used for parameter optimization in machine learning This conceptual framework can be leveraged to develop algorithms that accelerate optimization using nonlocal transport I will conclude by showing that using neuron birthdeath processes in parameter optimization guarantees global convergence and provides a substantial acceleration in practice Special Data Science Initiative Talk Grant Rotskoff New York University

Ends of the House: Deconstructing the Dream in the Late Industrial Urban Midwest will be presented by Catherine Fennell, an associate professor of anthropology at Columbia University. This anthropological paper focuses on the burgeoning house deconstruction movement in the late industrial urban Midwest. Through this case, it maps an emerging ethos of collective life predicated upon embracing, rather than denying or resenting intense forms of ecological and economic degradation. Fennells work focuses on the decline and transformation of a key infrastructure of the 20th century US welfare state -- subsidized housing. She interrogates how the material and social legacies of such housing shape the politics of difference, collective care and obligation, and utopian imagination in the urban Midwest. Part of the Development and Governance Seminar series.CLACS: Face Offs Between Families & Nation-States Please join CLACS on Wednesday, 4/10 for “Face Offs Between Transnational Families and Nation-States on Five Continents” with Gail Mummert (Resident at Brown’s Population Studies Training Center, PSTC), to be held at 12 pm in the McKinney Conference Room at the Watson Institute, 111 Thayer St.
Dancing Days in Authoritarian Brazil Join us for at noon today for a talk titled "Dancing Days: Nationalism, Soap Operas, and Dreams of Modernization in Authoritarian Brazil." Paula Halperin will examine the relations between the Brazilian military regime (1964 – 1985), the emergence of the television network Rede Globo in 1965, and its growing influence during the 1970s and 1980s. The regime invested heavily in infrastructure, allowing the new medium to expand nationally and to establish a cultural hegemony that lasted for over three decades. In her talk, she will closely analyze the popular soap opera Dancing Days (10 July 1978 and ended on 26 January 1979), mapping the consolidation of a new kind of aesthetics and teledramaturgy that channeled the aspirations and anxieties surrounding the project of conservative modernization promoted by the regime.

Paula Halperin is Associate Professor of Cinema Studies and History at SUNY Purchase. Her research integrates media, history, and the public sphere in Brazil during the twentieth century. She has published a range of essays on cinema, television, race, gender, and the process of “being Brazilian.” Her articles have appeared in academic journals in the United States, Brazil, and Argentina. She is currently finishing her manuscript Nationalism and Historical Imagination. Popular Cinema in 1970s and 1980s Brazil and Argentina. She also writes film criticism for websites and blogs.
A New mHealth Technology Paradigm? The Brown Center for Biomedical Informatics welcomes Dr. Gari D. Clifford to discuss "A New mHealth Technology Paradigm?". According to Save the Children and the World Health Organization, over one million newborns die within 24 hours of birth every year, mostly from preventable problems. To address this, Save the Children recommended a commitment to spending at least $60 per capita on training maternity workers. In this talk Dr. Clifford will discuss an approach to intensive training for maternity workers in low resource settings, based on his recent work in rural Guatemala. Dr. Clifford will review a comprehensive perinatal monitoring system which was co-designed with the local community health workers in Guatemala. Several principles of technology design for resource-constrained environments will be reviewed including: user interface design, scalable implementations and financial sustainability. The discussion will also touch on the role and potential for artificial intelligence in medicine, using the example of diagnosis of Intra-uterine Growth Restriction. Focusing on an example of perinatal healthcare in rural highland Guatemala as a recent successful example, Dr. Clifford will review these issues and highlight the cross-disciplinary team dynamics that were required. For more information on Dr. Clifford’s work please visit his website: http://gdclifford.info

TODAY - Darrell M. West – The Future of Work Robots, artificial intelligence, and driverless cars no longer represent things of the future. They are with us and will become common in coming years, along with virtual reality and digital assistants. As these tools advance deeper into everyday use, they raise the question—how will they transform society, the economy, and politics?

In this talk, Darrell M. West will discuss his newest book The Future of Work: Robots, AI, and Automation, and the need to rethink the concept of jobs, reconfigure the social contract, move toward a system of lifetime learning, and develop a new kind of politics that can deal with economic dislocations. He will cover a number of proposals to help people deal with the transition from an industrial to a digital economy. This includes creating new forms of job identity, emphasizing leisure activities in the arts, music, and culture, and making fundamental political reforms.

Dr. West feels that it is vital to address these issues in order to avoid widespread economic and political disruption.

Moderated by: Susan Moffitt, Director of the Taubman Center for American Politics and Policy

Ethical Audio Stories: a lunchtime panel Please join us for a lunchtime panel on the ethical considerations of audio storytelling in a racialized world.

Understanding the ethics of audio storytelling: If we are to be coming at the practice through a racial justice lens, does the code of ethics differ from journalistic professional ethics? Does it change the questions we ask? The way we interact with stories? How does this affect our notions of objectivity?

How to make the audio storytelling more accessible: When we say audio storytelling has a “low barrier to entry,” what aren't we considering in terms of resources and in terms of more complex cultural barriers?

General tips for teaching audio storytelling!

SAVE THE DATE: Book event with Dr. Arun K. Singh On Thursday, April 18, 2019, join us at the Brown Bookstore as we welcome Dr. Arun K. Singh for a discussion & signing of his forthcoming book, “Your Heart, My Hands: An Immigrant’s Remarkable Journey to Become One of America’s Preeminent Cardiac Surgeons”.

Leaving a life marked by crippling setbacks and his father’s doubt, in 1967 a twenty-something doctor from India arrived in America with only five dollars and the desire to claim his American dream. The journey still awaiting Dr. Arun K. Singh would be unparalleled. Faced with an entirely new culture, racism, and the lasting effects of disabling childhood injuries, through hard work and perseverance he overcame all odds. Now having performed over 15,000 open heart surgeries, more than nearly every surgeon in history, Dr. Singh reflects on his most memorable patients and his incredible personal life.

“An absorbing account of a man who arrived in America with five dollars in his pocket and went on to save tens of thousands of lives.” —Jhumpa Lahiri

Friedman Family Fund - Roger Levy, MIT LingLangLunch Seminar Series.  Speaker: Roger Levy, MIT.  Title: Implicit gender bias in preferred linguistic descriptions for expected events.  Abstract: Language production and comprehension involve rapid integration of diverse information sources.  Stereotypes---implicit mental associations among concepts---can influence event expectations and thus bias preferred linguistic descriptions. Above and beyond the effects of stereotypes on event expectations, however, can the mappings between event expectations and preferred linguistic descriptions themselves be biased?  Here we provide an affirmative answer in one test case: in English speakers' preferences regarding pronominal references to individuals whose gender is not known or determined, expectations that the individual might be female manifest in "she" pronoun preferences at a lower rate than expectations that the individual might be male manifest in "he" pronoun preferences. In large-scale experiments conducted during the 2016 US and 2017 UK electoral campaigns, where major-party candidates and fluctuating electoral prospects provided natural experiments in changing event expectations, we found that "she" references to the next head of state were consistently disadvantaged relative to election-outcome expectations.  In further experiments we find that this bias also generalizes more broadly to pronoun production preferences in a wider variety of contexts.  Finally, we investigate the influence of pronoun gender on event interpretation.  For a rational comprehender calibrated to the production preferences described above, the signal provided by "she" that the referent may be female should be stronger than the signal provided by "he" that the referent may be male.  In text memory experiments, however, we find the opposite to be the case.  Our combined experimental results imply that, in linguistic descriptions of events involving a individual whose gender may not be known, speaker expectations regarding that individual’s likely gender are not faithfully transmitted — rather, expectations that the individual may be female are systematically under-conveyed.  These findings pose challenges for rational theories of pragmatics, and exemplify how the tools of experimental psycholinguistics can contribute to our understanding of implicit cognition.

This talk reports ongoing work in collaboration with Veronica Boyce, Till Poppels, and Titus von der Malsburg.  An initial paper can be found at https://psyarxiv.com/n5ywr/.

M. Gomez-Barris Environmental Humanities Lecture Macarena Gómez-Barris will give a lecture “Forest Theory, Occupation, and an Archive of the Future” as part of the Environmental Humanities Initiative.

The tree and the forest is the site of environmental humanities and multidisciplinary inquiry. By engaging the materiality of land, place, and the idea of the tree as knowledge, Macarena Gómez-Barris addresses the forest as a particular site of material and representational evacuation. Extending ideas from her book "The Extractive Zone: Social Ecologies and Decolonial Perspectives" (Duke University Press, 2017) on Indigenous aesthetics and social movements, &#65279;&#65279;Gómez-Barris considers modes of thinking about archives, counter-visuality, resistance, and recovery that work against the inevitability of the forest’s elimination. Where does the regenerative potential exist that challenges and moves us beyond the paradigm of no future?

Macarena Gómez-Barris is Professor and Chairperson of Social Science and Cultural Studies at Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, New York. She is also Director of the Global South Center (GSC), a research center that works at the intersection of social ecologies, art and politics, and decolonial methodologies. Her instructional focus is on Latinx and Latin American Studies, memory and the afterlives of violence, decolonial theory, the art of social protest, and queer femme epistemes.

Brazilian Spring Film Series Tonight, the Brazil Initiative will be screening two films as part of its Spring film series, which is centered on indigenous themes.

 Bright Flower and the Scars from the Stone (Flor Brilhante e as cicatrizes da pedra, Jade Rainho, 2013): Bright Flower is the matriarch of an indigenous family of Guarani-Kaiowá shamans living in the Reserve of Dourados, Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil. There, deprived of their original way of life, they struggle to survive preserving ancient knowledge and culture, while dealing with the effects and ailments caused by the continuous explosions of an asphalt plant, which has been destroying and exploiting a sacred stone in the territory of the village for over 40 years.

The Dark Side of Green (À Sombra de um Delírio Verde, An Baccaert, Cristiano Navarro and Nico Muñoz, 2011): In the southern border region of Mato Grosso do Sul, on the border with Paraguay, the most populous indigenous nation of the country silently struggles for its territory, trying to contain the advance of its powerful enemies. Expelled from their lands because of the continuous process of colonization, more than 40,000 Guarani Kaiowá live nowadays on less than 1% of their original territory. Thousands of hectares of sugarcane are planted on their lands by multinational companies that, in agreement with the government, present ethanol to the world as an environmentally friendly and “clean” fuel. Without their lands and forests, the Guarani Kaiowá have struggled for years with an epidemic of malnutrition that afflicts their children. With no alternative for subsistence, adults and children are exploited in the cane fields for grueling labor. On the production line of the “clean” fuel, the Federal Public Prosecutor constantly sues the owners of the plants because of the child and slave labor found there. Amid the delirium of the "green gold fever" (the name given to the sugarcane), indigenous leadership that face this imposition of power many times find death ordered by big farmers as their fate.

Co-sponsored by Portuguese and Brazilian Studies, and Native American and Indigenous Studies at Brown.

Challenges to Brazilian Democracy Conference Day 1 From April 18 to April 21, the Brazil Initiative will be hosting a conference where scholars and activists from all over Brazil and the United States will come together to discuss challenges to Brazilian democracy.

The recent election of Jair Bolsonaro to the Brazilian presidency has raised new questions about the state of democracy in Brazil. Are his campaign promises to criminalize social movements, stop the demarcation of indigenous lands, and eliminate opposition political parties or merely electoral rhetoric? What does increased deforestation of the Amazon and other sensitive ecological zones mean for the environment? What is the fate of academic and cultural freedom under a new government whose supporters speak, among other questions, against “gender ideology” and “political correctness,” which can be read as veiled critiques of the women’s and the LGBTQI+ movements and the ideas of progressive social sectors? Will new gun policies result in more deaths in rural and urban areas, and particularly among people of African and indigenous descent? To what extent are human rights, especially among low-income citizens, under threat? This international conference, organized jointly with colleagues from Harvard University, will bring together scholars and social and cultural activists to analyze the current situation in Brazil and assess these and other threats to democracy posed by President Bolsonaro’s far-right agenda. At the Conference, we will also launch the US Observatory for Democracy in Brazil, an English-language website documenting recent events in the country, and have a strategic discussion about how U.S.-based academics and activists can defend democracy in Brazil.

Anton-Lippitt Lecture - Houston: Prophetic City This year’s Anton-Lippitt lecture will focus on the theme of community engagement, citizenship, and partnerships.

The open keynote event features Stephen L. Klineberg, Professor Emeritus of Sociology at Rice University and the founding-director of the Kinder Institute for Urban Research.

Houston clearly exemplifies the trends that are refashioning the social and political landscape across America. The new high-tech, knowledge-based, fully global economy is generating mounting inequalities based primarily on access to quality education. At the same time, an epic transformation is underway, as this city and country, once predominantly composed of European nationalities, is rapidly becoming a microcosm of all the world’s ethnicities and religions. And as urban regions compete for the “knowledge workers” in the new economy, quality-of-place attributes now increasingly determine the fates of cities. The panel reviews the findings from 38 years of systematic surveys to show how the new realities are unfolding, to assess the changing attitudes and beliefs of the general public, and to consider the implications of these ongoing trends for the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead.

Together with several panelists, Professor Klineberg will discuss how some destination cities have evolved toward inclusion and explore the institutions and strategies that support inclusive evolution.

Panelists include:

Angela Blanchard, Brown University
Amanda Edwards, Houston City Council
Armando Walle, Texas House of Representatives

Moderated by: Susan Moffitt, Director of the Taubman Center for American Politics and Policy

Llerena Searle — Power to the karigar? Llerena Searle — Power to the karigar? Craft in elite Indian home decor

Llerena Searle is an Assistant Professor of Anthropology at the University of Rochester. Searle's research explores the social, cultural, and geographical changes that have accompanied globalization in South Asia and the ways in which capitalist practices shape urban space. Her first book, Landscapes of Accumulation: Real Estate and the Neoliberal Imagination in Contemporary India, has just been published with the University of Chicago Press. The book explains the rapid growth of Indian cities and the proliferation of new malls, high-rises, and office parks across India by examining the practices and ideas of those who fund real estate projects. Prof Searle worked with international financiers and real estate developers to understand how they transform Indian buildings into legible assets available to international networks of speculative finance.

Cómo hacer la historia de la “gente menuda” en el Siglo de Oro?” This talk will take place on April 25 at 5:30pm in the Music Room at Rochambeau House. Organized by the Graduate Students of the Department of Hispanic Studies, Co-sponsored by the Departments of History and Comparative Literature, and the John Carter Brown Library.

Abstract: 
La “gente menuda” es el nombre con el que en el Siglo de Oro se denominaba a ganapanes, pinches de cocina, criados y criadas de escaleras abajo. Se les consideraba gritadores, desatinados, débiles o despreocupados de su propia bastardía. Parafraseando a Gómez de Mieses (1658), habían nacido para número y no para héroes.
En esta conferencia se propone, a través de distintas fuentes ante todo judiciales, reconstruir las vidas de esta “gente menuda”, mujeres y hombres con nombre. Gracias a ellas, se pueden conocer la solidaridad entre personas esclavizadas, los negocios ocultos de una criada, la prendería de una alquiladora de joyas, las desventuras en la corte de músicos de Nueva España o de India y de peregrinos llegados de Caldea o Japón. En suma, experiencias de vida en un mundo ampliado, pero que también se ha hecho más pequeño y sin cuya evocación quizá no estaría completa nuestra comprensión del Siglo de Oro.

Social Cognitive Science Seminar Series  Michael S. Goodman '74 Memorial Seminar Series.  Speaker: Jon Freeman, NYU.  Title: More than meets the eye: Split-second social perception.   Abstract: Initial social perceptions are often thought to reflect direct read-outs of facial features. Our recent research suggests that they instead emerge from an automatic yet gradual process of negotiation between the perceptual cues inherent to a person (e.g., facial cues) and top-down social cognitive processes harbored within perceivers. Integrative evidence from real-time behavioral paradigms (e.g., mouse-tracking), brain-imaging, and computational modeling will be discussed. This work shows that perceptions of a face’s gender, race, emotion, and even trait inferences (e.g., trustworthiness) are fundamentally shaped by context and one’s own stereotypes, prior knowledge, and intergroup experiences. We find that these top-down impacts on initial perceptions are driven by the interplay of higher-order prefrontal regions involved in top-down predictions and lower-level fusiform regions involved in face processing. These dynamics can create systematic visual biases, which we show in certain cases may uniquely predict real-world behaviors, such as female politicians’ electoral failure or racial prejudice—independent of group membership itself. Together, this work suggests that split-second social perceptions are malleable and shaped by context and higher-order social cognition. In turn, such malleability can create biases during initial perceptions that shape real-world behavior and may serve as a foundation for certain forms of prejudice.
Panel: Agility, Engineering and Adaptation Join IBES for this unique panel discussion, featuring Brown faculty and visiting scholars. Presentations will include: “Climate Change, Species Extinction and Controversial Conservation Interventions,” “Why space research matters in a warming world: Perspectives on Planet Earth from Space Exploration,” “Human exploration’s next destinations,” “Scale, ecological science writing, the terrarium and science fiction,” and “The African Grey Parrot as a Space Traveler.”

Hope to see you there!
Keynote: You Matter More Than You Think Are we heading for societal collapse? Are we doomed for extinction? Global change research tells us that we are on a dangerous path, and that we have a small window of opportunity to respond. However, at a time when radical transformations are called for, most people feel they cannot make a difference. In this talk, guest speaker Karen O’Brien will explain why we may be underestimating our individual and collective capacity for social change. Drawing on the emerging field of quantum social theory, she will discuss the role of metaphors, meaning-making, consciousness, and creativity in “mattering.” O’Brien will suggest that subtle shifts can empower quantum social change, and that each of us matter more than we think. Reception will follow.
Psychoanalysis event: Freud, Transeference, Moses Come join the Brown university Psychoanalysis Society (BUPS) for two very interesting talks.

In Analysis Terminable and Interminable (1937), Freud addresses the bitter reproach of his close colleague, dear friend and analysand, Sandor Ferenczi, that he should have foreseen the negative transference and directed the treatment on the basis of this prophecy. Written after Ferenczi’s death and at the end of Freud’s life, this crucial paper inextricably links the phenomenon of transference to the potential for an analysis to come to a conclusion.  By way of examining their shared fascination with telepathy and thought transference – as well as their divergent thinking on matters occult  -- we may discover a new way to consider the limits and possibilities of the psychoanalytic cure.

Our first speaker, Ona Nierenberg, Ph.D.  is a psychoanalyst in private practice in New York City and a Senior Psychologist at Bellevue Hospital Center, where she was Director of HIV Psychological Services for thirteen years. She is also a Clinical Instructor in the Department of Psychiatry at New York University Langone Medical Center, a member of Après-Coup Psychoanalytic Association, New York, an Honorary Member of Lacan Toronto, and an Overseas Member of the Association for Psychoanalysis & Psychotherapy in Ireland.

 Freud’s reading of Michelangelo’s statue of Moses is an analytic response to a political situation, the secessions of 1912-1914 that were rocking the psychoanalytic movement.  Like Moses (a figure he would return to during the crisis of the 1930s), Freud never ceased to act in order to preserve something even under the most difficult and threatening conditions. Departing from the received tradition stemming from the biblical text, in The Moses of Michelangelo Freud takes up those traces and significations that were disavowed by those who insisted on seeing only what they wanted to see. Freud’s ‘profane’ interpretation of the gesture made by Moses in his handling of the tablets takes on the character of an analytic act – the ethics of inventing something new with psychoanalysis.

Salvatore F. Guido, LCSW, Ph.D. is a psychoanalyst in private practice in New York City.  He has taught Freud and psychoanalysis at The New School, New York University, and Pratt Institute.  He is a member and faculty member of Après-Coup Psychoanalytic Association, an overseas member of the Association of Psychoanalysis and Psychotherapy in Ireland (APPI), and an honorary member of Lacan Toronto.

Food will be served!!

May 3-4: Conference – Nicaragua 1979 - 2019 The conference, "Nicaragua 1979-2019: The Sandinista Revolution After 40 Years" is free and open to the public. Registration is required. To register, please go to the conference registration page. In 1979, a revolution led by Sandinista guerrillas overthrew an entrenched dynastic regime in Nicaragua. The Sandinistas promised land reform, universal literacy and health care, expanded rights for women and minority groups, and a government that would respond to basic needs in their impoverished country. They had been in power only a short time when the “contra” rebellion, encouraged and financed by the United States, emerged to challenge their power. During the 1980s Nicaragua became a Cold War battleground, with Washington, Havana, and Moscow jousting for power and influence. Tens of thousands of Nicaraguans died in this conflict. Forty years later, the revolution remains unresolved. What have been its victories? What have been its failures? What have been its unintended consequences? What are the sources of civil strife and political conflict that have led to a new crisis in Nicaragua today? This conference brings together senior figures who shaped Nicaragua during the Sandinista era—politicians, diplomats, academics, public intellectuals, and journalists—to assess the revolution and its lessons, tell its stories, and leave a legacy for history. You may attend one or all panel discussions. Friday, May 3: 8:30 a.m. – 6:00 p.m. Saturday, May 4: 8:30 a.m. – 1:30 p.m.

Tariq Omar Ali — Jute and Peasant Life in Bengal  Tariq Omar Ali — A Local History of Global Capital: Jute and Peasant Life in the Bengal Delta

Assistant Professor of History at the University of Illinois. Tariq completed his dissertation titled "The Envelope of Global Trade: Political Economy and Intellectual History of Jute in the Bengal Delta, the 1850s to the 1950s" at Harvard University in August 2012. In his dissertation and current manuscript project, Tariq explores how the Bengal delta's integration into global circuits of commodity and capital shaped local economic, political and intellectual histories as well as how economic lives, social and cultural formations, and political processes in the delta were informed and influenced by the cultivation and trade of jute. Alongside his work on jute in east Bengal during the colonial period, Tariq is also working on the history of rural development in post-colonial Pakistan.

He is interested in how the discourse and practice of rural development and agrarian modernization informed processes of nation and state formation in post-colonial East Pakistan between 1947 and 1971.Tariq teaches courses in South Asian history, agrarian and peasant histories, and histories of capitalism and commodities.

MES Luncheon – Syrian Refugees in Jordan Organized by Middle East Studies, Rawar Arar (Postdoctoral Fellow in International and Public Affairs), examines the case of Jordan, a state that hosts 2.7 million refugees in a total population of 9.5 million people. Jordan protects sovereignty in the face of porous borders and the interference of international institutions and foreign states, while providing numerous government services to millions of refugees. Her research, conducted as an ethnography of the state, shows that sovereignty is a relational process enacted through quotidian practices not only from the top-down—by government and international officials—but also from the bottom-up through the daily decisions of refugees and citizens. Lunch provided, registration required.
The End of the Line Screening Scientists predict that if we continue fishing at the current rate, the planet will run out of seafood by 2048 with catastrophic consequences. Based on the book by Charles Clover, and narrated by Ted Danson, The End of the Line explores the devastating effect that overfishing is having on fish stocks and the health of our oceans.

The documentary looks at the consequences of unchecked, unregulated sea fishing across the globe. It is not a film about what might happen, it is a film about what has happened. The collapse of the cod population saw the end of 40,000 jobs, the bluefin tuna is being hunted to extinction, and it takes five kilos of anchovies to produce one fish farmed salmon.

Join the Sustainable Food Initiative for a screening of The End of the Line, followed by a panel discussion by experts in the field.

cognition seminar series   nicholas turk browne michael s  goodman  74 memorial seminar series  speaker  dr  nicholas turk browne  yale university   title  rethinking memory systems for statistical learning   abstract  there is a fundamental tension in human memory between encoding episodic memories for individual experiences from life and extracting statistical regularities that hold across these experiences  the tension arises from the fact that these two forms of learning have opposite computational requirements  episodic memory requires rapid  even one shot learning of representations stored separately from related memories to avoid interference  statistical learning accumulates gradually over time by strengthening common elements that overlap across representations  for this reason  it has long been thought that memory is supported by a division of labor in the brain  with the hippocampus supporting episodic encoding and the neocortex supporting statistical learning  in this talk i will present a series of converging findings from fmri  neuropsychological patients  intracranial recordings  and neural network modeling that challenge this elegant and influential theory  namely  i will show that the hippocampus is important for rapid statistical learning and will provide an updated theoretical account about how the same hippocampal system implements these competing computations in different subfields and pathways  i will end with some new findings that arise from this perspective about behavior and development

social cognitive science seminar   elinar amit michael s  goodman    74 memorial seminar series   social cognitive science seminar series   speaker  elinor amit  brown university   title  what memories are made of  distance dependent memory for visual and verbal information   abstract  our ability to prospect into the future enables us to make predictions and plan for future events  and therefore constitutes a clear evolutionary advantage  a large body of research shows that memory is an adaptive tool that plays a role in prospection  how does the mental architecture of the memory system serve this function  consistent with the functional theory of mental representation  amit et al   2009   in this talk i will argue that one way it does so is by using qualitatively different representational formats   visual and verbal   depending on the psychological distance of the target from the individual  i will provide evidence that the memory system facilitates memory for congruent combinations of representational formats and distance  i e   visual representations of proximal targets and verbal representations of distal targets  than vice versa  across multiple distance dimensions and multiple memory tasks  together  these findings lend support to the idea that episodic memory is not an automatic recording device but rather a tool  which serves the needs and goals of the individual  in particular  the mental architecture of the memory system is designed in an efficient way to prospect about the future  using different cognitive devices for different needs

linglanglunch seminar series  michael s  goodman    74 memorial seminar series   linglanglunch   speakers  lynnette arnold  paja faudree  brown university   title  language and social justice  teaching about the    word gap       abstract  contemporary work in sociolinguistics and linguistic anthropology is increasingly taking up social justice as an explicit framework  building on historical scholarship that laid the foundation for understanding how language use is tied to social inequality  in such efforts  educational contexts are crucial settings for intervention  sites where sharing scholarly insights about language can provoke effective public conversations about the roots and contemporary manifestations of social inequality linked to language  inspired by this work  we suggest that conducting such language related educational efforts within our institutions of higher education can make crucial contributions to the advancement of social justice  in this talk  we describe our efforts to offer workshops on language and social justice for students involved in service learning  as part of the swearer center co curriculum  we discuss in detail a workshop that focused on the topic of the    word gap     research on disparities in how children perform in school that is based on the notion that the vocabulary of children from low income communities lags behind that of their more affluent peers  this research claims that by the time they enter kindergarten  low income children display a 30 million word deficit when compared to higher income students  narratives about this so called    word gap    are among the most pervasive discourses about language and social inequality in the united states today  and have inspired programs around the country designed to illuminate this disparity   including  here in providence  the 5 million dollar initiative providence talks  however  such interventions  and the research on which they are based  have also been the target of substantive critiques by linguistic anthropologists and sociolinguists  we suggest that teaching students and others about the    word gap    debate can help them gain a deeper understanding of how language works to uphold and continually reproduce social inequalities  while also inspiring them to think about how language can be used as a tool for challenging these injustices

today   urban citizenship in policed communities cities  citizens and governance lecture     the state from below  urban citizenship in policed communities  professor vesla weaver   s lecture will highlight research that uses new technology to initiate conversations about policing in highly policed communities and discuss what her findings reveal about urban citizenship  based on over 850 recorded and transcribed conversations across ten neighborhoods in five cities  the lecture reveals four currents that challenge liberal democratic framings of political life  that an arrangement of distorted responsiveness characterizes the relationship between policed communities and the state  that the political desire of policed communities is not for greater engagement and responsiveness but for political recognition     to be known by the state  that in contrast to prevailing wisdom about uninformed electorates  these citizens have too much knowledge of and too little power vis    vis state representatives  and that it has been observed among policed communities that there is an    ethics of aversion    in their political responses  a belief that power is best achieved by receding from state institutions in the short term and forging their own collective  community autonomy in the long term   this lecture will convene scholars from around the world to engage with one another on the possibilities and challenges of promoting urban citizenship by exploring the structural  institutional  and political processes that cities develop to incorporate or exclude existing and aspiring citizens

linglanglunch seminar series michael s  goodman  74 memorial seminar series   speaker   stefan kaufmann  university of connecticut   title  how fake is fake past  abstract  english subjunctive conditionals have a past or past perfect form on the modal scoping over the consequent  typically  would  or  might    which is echoed in the tense marking on the antecedent  this past  perfect  does not seem to have its ordinary temporal interpretation  as it even shows up when the constituents refer to future times  this phenomenon is known as  fake past  or  fake tense    much recent work on fake past concerns its relationship with temporal past  there are two schools of thought on this issue     past as past    approaches rely on models of branching time and interpret counterfactuals by    re running    history from an earlier time at which the antecedent was still a possibility  thus the past is not  entirely  fake after all     past as modal    approaches assume instead that on its fake use  the past is    redirected    from the temporal dimension in which it normally enables reference to different times  to the perpendicular modal dimension  now enabling reference to different worlds  a question that has not received nearly as much attention is how a theory of either stripe is to be integrated with an overall account of tense and temporal reference in conditionals  including indicatives  this paper argues that such a unified account can be achieved by extending kaufmann s  2005b  treatment of tense and temporal reference in indicatives to subjunctives  a significant amount of evidence for this analysis comes from observations on english and japanese counterfactuals  i argue that despite the many differences between these languages  the basic tenets of the analysis carry over surprisingly well  part of this talk is based on joint with teruyuki mizuno  uconn grad student

perception   action seminar series michael s  goodman  74 memorial seminar series   speaker 1  zhenyu zhu  brown university   title  the combination of heading specified by optic flow and target egocentric direction during goal  oriented locomotion   abstract  previous research suggests that heading specified by optic flow and target egocentric direction are used for the control of walking toward a goal  for my undergraduate thesis  i examined whether these two cues are optimally combined in this process  i measured the reliability of both cues in perceiving heading by asking human participants to perform walking tasks and perception tasks in virtual reality environments  it is found that though the two cues are indeed combined  they might not be optimally combined   speaker 2  ivan rodriguez  brown university   title  automatic video monitoring of honeybee foraging behavior using convolutional neural networks   abstract  in this work  the recognition of pollen bearing honey bees from videos of the entrance of the hive is presented  this computer vision task is a key component for the automatic monitoring of honeybees in order to obtain large scale data of their foraging behavior and task specialization   several approaches are considered for this task  including baseline classifiers  shallow convolutional neural networks  and deeper networks from the litera  ture  the experimental comparison is based on a new dataset of images of hon  eybees that was manually annotated for the presence of pollen  the proposed approach  based on convolutional neural networks is shown to outperform the other approaches in terms of accuracy   the proposed system builds on the recent advances in computer vision for human pose estimation using deep learning methods  in particular  we used body part detection and part affinity fields for pose estimation using the anatomy of honeybees  using this method we obtained 98  recall for part detec  tion and 95  of correct part association  for pollen recognition  the proposed method with pre alignment of the images using the pose estimation reached 100  accuracy  compared to 96  using only bee location   relying on the precision of the detection  tracking was performed using the hungarian assignment algorithm  with this information  behaviour classifica  tion for foraging behaviour was performed by classifying trajectories into entries and exit   this set of methods was implemented on the high performance computing facility servers and applied to a week of video recordings  the results show the potential of the proposed models as a tool for studying honey bee behaviour at ethological and ecological level   acknowledgement  this material is based upon work supported by the national science foundation under grants no 1707355 and 1633184 
today    how much does schooling pay   in this talk  diprete draws on systematic analysis of cross national data from the u s   germany  and france to ask  does learning occupation specific skills enhance one s labor market outcomes  is it beneficial to have an educational degree that is linked to only one or a small set of occupations  diprete argues that  because there is a great deal of variation in the strength of the education labor market link across western societies  the answers to these questions are highly dependent on how strongly linked the education system is to the labor market  amid rising income inequality  an institutional environment that promotes strong school to work pathways appears to be an effective strategy for providing workers with secure  well paying jobs

srp seminar  linda m  abriola in search of the silver bullet  progress and perspectives on contaminated subsurface characterization and restoration   linda m  abriola   chlorinated solvent contamination of aquifers is a recalcitrant problem that has challenged environmental engineering professionals  regulators  and site managers for decades  when solvents are introduced to the subsurface  whether through accidental spills or leaking containment facilities  they create a persistent contaminant source to flowing groundwater  posing a long term health risk to downstream receptors  over the past thirty years  a great deal of research has been undertaken to advance our understanding of the migration and fate of these chlorinated compounds  also known as dense nonaqueous liquids or dnapls  and to develop innovative methods for their destruction and or recovery  despite these advances  however  it is now generally accepted that no single technology will result in complete mass removal  in addition  future progress in the management of sites containing dnapl source zones is hampered by the difficulties associated with characterizing the location and distribution of dnapl mass  commonly termed    architecture     which tends to control contaminant plume evolution and longevity   this presentation provides an overview of interdisciplinary research designed to improve our ability to predict the migration and fate of dnapls in natural subsurface formations and to develop improved methodologies for site characterization and management  numerical simulations and experimental observations are used to illustrate advances in our understanding of the hydrologic and abiotic and biotic transformation processes influencing dnapl transport and persistence  the presentation highlights the severe challenges  posed by the presence of natural heterogeneities  to reliable predictions of subsurface system behavior  recent research results demonstrate the potential utility of innovative statistical and machine learning methods for site characterization and risk assessment

cognition seminar series  michael s  goodman  74 memorial seminar series   speaker  debbie yee  brown university   title  neural mechanisms of motivational incentive integration and cognitive control   abstract  humans regularly consider a wide variety of incentives when pursuing behavioral goals  our prior work indicates different motivational incentives combine to influence cognitive task performance  yee et al   2016   yet there is currently a poor understanding of the mechanisms by which incentive integration occurs in the brain  we developed an innovative fmri task paradigm that quantifies dissociable and integrative effects of liquid valence and monetary rewards on cognitive control  healthy young adults performed a cued task switching task to earn varying monetary reward amounts  low  medium  high   with oral liquid delivery serving as post trial performance feedback that signaled successful attainment of monetary reward for fast accurate responses  due to the symbolic meaning of the liquid  blocked effects of liquid valence on behavior and neural activity were taken to reflect incentive integration  our results revealed that bundled bold activation in dorsal anterior cingulate cortex  dacc  was significantly predicted by behavioral task performance  reward rate   and self report motivation ratings  these results support theoretical accounts suggesting that dacc encodes the expected value of cognitive control  and point to the utility of using diverse incentives to study the effects of integrated value signals on cognitive control

perception   action seminar series michael s  goodman  74 memorial seminar series   speaker  dr  jon matthis  northeastern university   title  retinal optic flow and the visual control of locomotion over real world rough terrain   abstract  human locomotion through natural environments requires the coordination of all levels of the sensorimotor hierarchy  from the cortical areas involved in processing of visual information and high level planning to the subcortical and spinal structures involved in the regulation of the gait and posture  in this talk  i will present some findings of an ongoing investigation into the way that the visual system interacts with the biomechanical aspects of gait in order to support stable locomotion over real world rough terrain  this research utilizes a novel apparatus to record 3d gaze and full body kinematics of walkers traversing different types of real world rough terrain  the results that walkers tune their gaze behavior in each terrain to the specific information needed to tailor their energetically optimal preferred gait cycle to the upcoming path in order to balance between the competing demands of efficiency and stability  i will conclude with some recent research that utilizes methods from computer vision to quantify the information in the visual stimulus experienced during natural locomotion   specifically  measuring the optic flow experienced during locomotion reveals patterns that are markedly different from descriptions in the literature on the neural processing of visual self motion  nevertheless  there are regularities to retina centered optic flow that suggest a much richer source of information that may be used to enact fine grained control of locomotion through the natural world
