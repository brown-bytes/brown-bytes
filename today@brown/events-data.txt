 LCDS Seminar Monday February pm Room Hope Street Jonathan Jaquette Brandeis University Title Computer assisted proofs of Wrights and Jones Conjectures Counting and discounting slowly oscillating periodic solutions to a delay differential equation Abstract A classical example of a nonlinear delay differential equations is Wrights equation yt alpha yt yt considering alpha gt and ytgt This talk discusses two conjectures associated with this equation Wrights conjecture which states that the origin is the global attractor for all alpha in pi and Jones conjecture which states that there is a unique slowly oscillating periodic solution for alpha gt pi To prove Wrights conjecture our approach relies on a careful investigation of the neighborhood of the Hopf bifurcation occurring at alpha pi Using a rigorous numerical integrator we characterize slowly oscillating periodic solutions and calculate their stability proving Jones conjecture for alpha in and thereby all alpha We complete the proof of Jones conjecture using global optimization methods extended to treat infinite dimensional problems LCDS Seminar presents Jonathan Jaquette Brandeis University

 Abstract A longstanding goal in neuroscience is to achieve a complete understanding of the central nervous system from the brain as a whole all the way down to individual neurons and synapses A fundamental challenge in achieving this goal is bridging knowledge gaps impeded by the difficulty in integrating experimental measurements across different scales for example between computations in local circuits and communication across brain areas In the mammalian neocortex corticocortical connections formed by longrange projection neurons across different areas are essential for higher cognitive function I will present the development of new technologies that enable simultaneous recordings of identified longrange projection neurons across cortical areas Using the mouse tactile whisker sensorimotor system as a model I will describe the application of such methods for dissecting the role of longrange networks in the neocortex during sensoryguided decision making Dissecting LongRange Cortical Networks During Behavior
 Xingjie LiDepartment of Mathematics and StatisticsUNC Charlotte Coarsegraining of Langevin dynamics via the MoriZwanzig formalism Abstract The MoriZwanzig formalism is applied to derive equations for the evolution of linear observables of the Langevin dynamics for both overdamped and general cases To illustrate the resulting equations and their use in deriving approximate models some particular benchmark examples are studied both numerically and via a formal asymptotic expansion The examples considered demonstrates the importance of memory effects and asymptotic estimates in determining the correct temporal behavior of such systems Scientific Computing Seminar presents Xingjie Li

 Tyler Van Buren PhD Research Scholar at Princeton will present a talk Improving Performance of Unsteady Propulsors through Biological Inspiration Abstract Many species of aquatic life have evolved to swim fast and efficiently over long distances Some of these swimmers such as dolphin and tuna use propulsion methods where the principal thrust comes from oscillating a propulsive airfoillike surface such as a fluke or caudal fin Using these biological systems as inspiration we hope to develop propulsion systems with better maneuverability efficiency and speed Here we will explore the physical mechanisms that govern the performanceespecially swimming speed and efficiencyof unsteady propulsive techniques inspired by biology We will see that scaling laws developed from basic principles can be used to model the performance of these types of propulsors Moreover we can use this model as a guide to achieve superior function for example by modifying the aerodynamic shape of the propulsors Through a better understanding of aquatic swimmers we can extend the performance of humanmade propulsors beyond the limits of biology Bio Dr Van Buren is a Research Scholar in the Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering Department at Princeton University working under Prof Alexander Smits He received his PhD from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute RPI under the advisement of Prof Michael Amitay Currently his research interests are in unsteady aerodynamicshydrodynamics bioinspired propulsion turbulent structure and stability and flow control devicesstrategies Learn more at wwwvanburenlabscom Fluids at Brown Division of Applied Mathematics Fluids and Thermal Sciences School of Engineering Joint Seminar Series

 Michael S Goodman Memorial Colloquium Speaker Karolina Lempert University of Pennsylvania Title Understanding how people make decisions about the future Abstract Just about every important choice we make involves consequences that extend beyond the here and now Existing models of such choices often called intertemporal choices are limited they both ignore the psychological mechanisms underlying those choices and they assume that peoples preferences are stable across time domains and contexts My research aims to uncover the cognitive mechanisms contributing to intertemporal choices by capturing and quantifying the disparate factors that impact these decisions My approach is interdisciplinary borrowing mathematical models and experimental paradigms from economics and methodologies from neuroscience to answer psychological questions My work has identified three novel factors that influence intertemporal choices which I will describe in this talk individual differences in declarative memory the recent history of offers in the task and the nature of the intertemporal problem itself I will conclude by highlighting broader future directions that this research inspires Karolina Lempert University of Pennsylvania

 Optimizing the Automated Programming Stack The scale and pervasiveness of modern software poses a challenge for programmers software reliability is more important than ever but the complexity of computer systems continues to grow Automated programming tools are powerful weapons for programmers to tackle this challenge verifiers that check software correctness and synthesizers that generate new correctbyconstruction programs These tools are most effective when they apply domainspecific optimizations but doing so today requires considerable formal methods expertise In this talk I present a new applicationdriven approach to optimizing the automated programming stack underpinning modern domainspecific tools I will demonstrate the importance of programming tools in the context of memory consistency models which define the behavior of multiprocessor CPUs and whose subtleties often elude even experts Our new tool MemSynth automatically synthesizes formal descriptions of memory consistency models from examples of CPU behavior We have used MemSynth to synthesize descriptions of the x and PowerPC memory models each of which previously required personyears of effort to describe by hand and found several ambiguities and underspecifications in both architectures I will then present symbolic profiling a new technique we designed and implemented to help people identify the scalability bottlenecks in automated programming tools These tools use symbolic evaluation which evaluates all paths through a program and is an execution model that defies both human intuition and standard profiling techniques Symbolic profiling diagnoses scalability bottlenecks using a novel performance model for symbolic evaluation that accounts for allpaths execution We have used symbolic profiling to find and fix performance issues in stateoftheart automated tools improving their scalability by orders of magnitude and our techniques have been adopted in industry Finally I will give a sense of the importance of future applicationdriven optimizations to the automated programming stack with applications that inspire improvements to the stack and in turn beget even more powerful automated tools James Bornholt is a PhD candidate in the Paul G Allen School of Computer Science amp Engineering at the University of Washington advised by Emina Torlak Dan Grossman and Luis Ceze His research interests are in programming languages and formal methods with a focus on automated program verification and synthesis His work has received an ACM SIGPLAN Research Highlight two IEEE Micro Top Picks selections an OSDI best paper award and a Facebook PhD fellowship Host Shriram Krishnamurthi Talk James Bornholt University of Washington

 Watch webcast Sarah Khan is a Postgraduate Associate at the Yale MacMillan Center Her research interests lie in gender and the political economy of development with a regional specialization in South Asia In this paper Khan develops and tests a theory of how gender inequality within the household is reproduced in the political sphere and undermines prospects for womens substantive representation Drawing on an original facetoface survey conducted in households in the Faisalabad district of Pakistan she shows that men and women within the same household prioritize systematically different public goods and services based on the contextspecific division of household labor Using a novel behavioral measure of political communication I demonstrate that women attach a lower value to their distinctive preferences than men and are less willing to communicate these preferences to political representatives The gendered asymmetry in preference assertion has implications for democratic theories of representation it suggests that the link between political participation and substantive representation may be undermined by gender inequality within the household Sarahs research interests lie at the intersection of gender and comparative politics with a regional specialization in South Asia In her work she explores gender gaps in political preferences and the barriers to womens participation and substantive representation in Pakistan In another strand of research she explores questions related to the prevention of violence against women Her research has been generously supported by grants from the American Institute of Pakistan Studies the Abdul Jameel Poverty Action Lab JPAL Governance Initiative and the National Science Foundation South Asia Seminar Sarah Khan Personal is Political Gendered Preference Expression in Pakistan

 Scientific Computing Seminar Friday February am Room Hope Street Mouhamadou Sy University of Virginia Title Probabilistic Method in the Study of Dispersive PDEs Abstract I will present two probabilistic approaches to the Cauchy theory and long time behavior of dispersives equations These approaches use particular measures defined on the phase space to establish a global flow for the corresponding PDEs The importance of such procedures is that many times these measures are concentrated on spaces where the deterministic Cauchy theory is not known or illposed Moreover the measures are left invariant by the flow that phenomenon implies recurrence of the solutions I will present then new results concerning the SQG and the D septic NLS equations PDE Seminar presents Mouhamadou Sy University of Virginia
 Version Control with Git Intended audience Students completely new to version control systems Git is the most popular version control system in the world today At its basic a version control system is like a backup system and a collaboration tool rolled into one Think Time Machine meets Google Docs but for plaintext files Most commonly these plaintext files are source code for software but they can also be prose books websites laws and so forthsome people use Git to distribute their own genetic code If you want to learn about Git you can find a million different materials online but they tend to be either recipes that dont show you the underlying ideas or comprehensive books that are overwhelming Come to my talk and youll walk out with a solid understanding of how Git works and know enough commands to get started You can come even if you already know one thing or two about Git youll have fun and may even learn a new Git trick to impress your friends Leandro Facchinetti was born in Brazil in He has a bachelors degree from the Universidade de So Paulo a masters degree from The Johns Hopkins University and is a PhD candidate at The Johns Hopkins University He does research in the field of programminglanguage theory and he is interested in program analysis and languageoriented programming Leandro believes that the main goal of academia is not only to produce research but also to communicate the results of this research effectively to a broader audience including computer scientists in industry and the rest of society To realize this view part of his research is dedicated to making program analysis more approachable including pedagogical implementations and tutorials Beyond programminglanguage theory he is interested in education and educational research He has assisted in courses throughout his career as a graduate student and he plans on continuing to work in this area as a lecturer and as an educational researcher Host Shriram Krishnamurthi Talk Leandro Facchinetti Johns Hopkins University

 Building systems that can understand visual concepts and describe them coherently in natural language is fundamental to artificial intelligence Advances in machine learning have had profound impact on computer vision and natural language processing There has been interesting progress in recent years at the intersection of these two fields producing systems that describe eg caption images and videos captured by personal cameras in ordinary scenes and street views Much work remains in this and a host of related problems including that of building natural language descriptions of commercial overhead imagery and videos where automation is greatly needed If we were to attempt to manually exploit the commercial satellite imagery we expect to have over the next years we would need eight million imagery analysts Robert Cardillo NGA Director GEOINT Symposium This workshop brings together researchers in machine learning computer vision natural language processing to discuss best practices in machine generated descriptions for both consumer and overhead imagery and videos Participants will identify challenges and recommend future research topics Image Description for Consumer and Overhead Imagery Feb

 The Network is the Computer Running Distributed Services on Programmable Switches Historically the conventional wisdom has been that networks should offer fixed functionality for forwarding packets and little else This appears to be changing as a new breed of programmable switches match the speed of fixed function devices This trend raises the question What services could and should sit in the forwarding plane In this talk we explore how a programmable forwarding plane can naturally accelerate the fundamental building blocks of distributed systems We identify and discuss three key issues for network acceleration i How do we actually program network devices What are the abstractions and limitations ii What is the right architecture these networkeddistributed systems iii Given that we are asking the network to do so much more work how can we be sure that it is implemented correctly Our results show how we can build provablycorrect distributed systems that provide ordersofmagnitude performance improvements over softwarebased alternatives Robert Soul is an associate professor at the Universit della Svizzera italiana USI and a Research Scientist at Barefoot Networks His research interests are in distributed systems networking and applied programming languages Prior to joining USI he was a postdoctoral associate at Cornell University He received his PhD from New York University in and his BA from Brown University in For two years he was a research coop in the Data Intensive Systems and Analytics Group at IBM T J Watson Research Center He is the recipient of an IBM Invention Plateau Award a Google Faculty Research Award and Best Paper Awards at ACM DEBS and USENIX NSDI Host Professor Shriram Krishnamurthi Talk Robert Soule Faculty of Informatics at Universita della Svizzera Italiana USI and Research Scientist at Barefoot Networks

 LCDS Seminar Monday February pm Room Hope Street Thomas Michael Harvard Title Bridging time and length scales in filamentous protein selfassembly Abstract Filamentous protein selfassembly is a process in which dispersed proteins assemble spontaneously to form ordered elongated structures This phenomenon is an essential characteristic of life finds widespread use in numerous nanotechnological applications but is also at the heart of pathologies of many types including Parkinsons and Alzheimers diseases To exploit protein selfassembly for nanotechnology or curtail it for medical purposes it is necessary to quantify the fundamental principles that control the way dispersed molecules assemble into these ordered structures The fundamental challenge in establishing such an understanding in a rigorous manner is the disparate nature of the spatial and temporal scales involved In this talk I demonstrate how we can address this challenge by bringing the power of physical methods to protein selfassembly to connect microscopic mechanisms with macroscopic observations of such phenomena In a first part of the talk I discuss a unified theory of the kinetics of filamentous protein assembly and show how these results reveal simple rate laws that provide the basis for interpreting experimental data in terms of specific mechanisms controlling the proliferation of fibrils I will then discuss how the resulting methods can guide us in the development of rational strategies for controlling aberrant protein aggregation in time and space I will bring together protein aggregation kinetics with optimal control theory to determine explicit optimal administration protocols of drugs that inhibit specific molecular events during the aggregation process I will also introduce ideas from liquidliquid phase separation to investigate how liquid cellular compartments could be implicated in spatially regulating protein aggregation LCDS Seminar presents Thomas Michael Harvard University

 Professor Konstantinos Danas Solid Mechanics Laboratory at CNRS Ecole Polytechnique will present a talk Microstructured Magnetorheological Elastomers and Instabilities Abstract Magnetorheological elastomers MREs are ferromagnetic particle impregnated rubbers whose mechanical properties are altered by the application of external magnetic fields In addition these composite materials can deform at very large strains due to the presence of the soft polymeric matrix without fracturing From an unconventional point of view a remarkable property of these materials is that while they can become unstable by combined magnetomechanical loading their response is well controlled in the postinstability regime This in turn allows us to try to operate these materials in this critically stable region These instabilities can lead to extreme responses such as wrinkles for haptic applications actively controlled stiffness for cellgrowth and acoustic properties with only marginal changes in the externally applied magnetic fields Unlike the current modeling of hierarchical composites MREs require the development of finitestrain coupled nonlinear magnetomechanical models in order to tailor the desired macroscopic instability response at finite strains As a proof of concept we study experimentally and theoretically the stability and postbifurcation of a nonlinear magnetoelastic filmsubstrate block in order to obtain active control of surface roughness The nonintuitive interplay between magnetic field and elastic deformation owes to material and geometry selection namely a ferromagnetic particle composite film bonded on a compliant passive foundation Cooperation of two otherwise independent loading mechanismsmechanical precompression and magnetic fieldallows to bring the structure near a marginally stable state and then destabilize it with either magnetic or mechanical fields We demonstrate for the first time that the critical magnetic field is a decreasing function of precompression and vice versa The experimental results are then probed successfully with fullfield finite element simulations at large strains and magnetic fields The magnetoelastic coupling allows for the reversible onoff control of surface wrinkling under adjustable critical magnetic and mechanical fields In this view this study constitutes a first step towards realistic active haptic and morphing devices Novel auxetic and chiral architected MREs are also proposed as potential candidates for future work Engineering Seminar Joint MaterialsSolid Mechanics

 Data Discovery Unleashing the Value of Data Organizations use only a small portion of all data they own Consequently most of the potential value is untapped This happens because their analysts suffer a data discovery problem when solving a task that requires data analysts spend more time finding the relevant data than solving the task at hand The core problem is that there is not adequate infrastructure to support the many different discovery problems organizations face Hence finding data remains largely a manual and timeconsuming process In this talk Ill present Aurum a system that radically changes how users interact with their organizationss data With Aurum users can solve discovery problems in minutes instead of weeks To achieve this Aurum has three novel features it makes data discovery programmable so users can solve many different discovery problems by writing different programs it solves data discovery queries fast so users can solve their problems in minutes instead of weeks it scales to large amounts of data so no relevant data is left behind In addition Ill explain how Aurum handles not only structured data such as tables in databases data lakes and spreadsheets but also unstructured data such as PDF files word documents and even conversations from Slack channels Ill conclude with a vision for how to make data easier to work with and to program a key ingredient needed to exploit all data available in organizations and enable new applications In my research I build highperformance systems for discovering preparing and processing data I often use techniques from data management statistics and machine learning At MIT I work with professors Sam Madden and Mike Stonebraker Before MIT I completed my PhD at Imperial College London with Peter Pietzuch Host Professor Stan Zdonik Talk Raul Castro Fernandez MIT

 Prof Raquel Assis Assistant Professor of Biology Penn State Eberly College of Science Evolution of Genomic Rearrangements in Animals and Plants Notorious for their roles in human disease genomic rearrangements are also major drivers of evolutionary change To understand this process my lab designs and applies computational and statistical approaches to infer the evolutionary outcomes and adaptive significance of genomic rearrangements from patterns in genomic and transcriptomic data within and among closely related species In this talk I will focus on our studies of two opposing classes of rearrangements gene duplications and deletions First I will summarize our research in utilizing multitissue gene expression profiles to identify evolutionary outcomes of gene duplication events in Drosophila mammals and grasses Of particular interest is that our findings suggest that the evolution of duplicate genes may be fueled by natural selection on male reproductive phenotypes in all three taxonomic groups Next I will describe how we explicitly tested this hypothesis in Drosophila by quantifying natural selection in duplicate genes and interrogating its types timing and targets Through these analyses we reveal that natural selection is indeed a key player in the evolution of Drosophila duplicate genes acts rapidly and in a regionspecific manner and may underlie the origin of male reproductive phenotypes Last I will discuss our recent work in assessing evolutionary outcomes of gene deletions in Drosophila Specifically we show that deletions typically result in losses of unique rather than redundant genes Moreover we uncover biases toward preferential deletion of carcassexpressed genes and retention of ovaryexpressed genes possibly implicating gene deletion in the evolution of female reproductive phenotypes in Drosophila Together these studies highlight the evolutionary importance of both gene duplications and deletions indicating that they may act in concert to promote adaptation of male and female reproductive phenotypes Hosted by Prof Emilia HuertaSanchez Evolution of Genomic Rearrangements in Animals and Plants

 Frederike Petzschner University of Zurich Psychiatry faces major challenges its nosology is agnostic about mechanisms lacks predictive validity and leads to trialanderror treatment Strikingly neuroscientific advances have hardly affected nosology or clinical practice One response to this disconnect is computational psychiatry with its emerging focus on clinical applications One strategy for computational psychiatry is to learn from internal medicine where mechanistic frameworks for differential diagnosis enable targeted treatment decisions for individual patients In my talk I will outline computational approaches to improve treatment prediction in OCD and provide a framework to explain and test maladaptive brainbody interactions in particular cardioception which may become increasingly relevant for differential diagnosis in psychosomatic disorders Computational Psychiatry and Computational Psychosomatics

 Limin Peng PhD Professor Biostatistics and Bioinformatics Rollins School of Public Health Emory University Title Quantile Regression Modeling of Latent Trajectory Features with Longitudinal Data Quantile regression has demonstrated promising utility in longitudinal data analysis Existing work is primarily focused on modeling crosssectional outcomes while outcome trajectories often carry more substantive information in practice In this work we develop a trajectory quantile regression framework that is designed to robustly and flexibly investigate how latent individual trajectory features are related to observed subject characteristics The proposed models are built under multilevel modeling with usual parametric assumptions lifted or relaxed We derive our estimation procedure by novelly transforming the problem at hand to quantile regression with perturbed responses and adapting the bias correction technique for handling covariate measurement errors We establish desirable asymptotic properties of the proposed estimator including uniform consistency and weak convergence Extensive simulation studies confirm the validity of the proposed method as well as its robustness An application to the DURABLE trial uncovers sensible scientific findings and illustrates the practical value of our proposals Brown Statistics C V Starr Lecture featuring Limin Peng PhD Emory University
 LCDS Seminar Monday March pm Room Hope Street Changfeng Gui University of Texas at San Antonio Title The Sphere Covering Inequality and its Applications AbstractIn this talk we introduce a new geometric inequality the Sphere Covering Inequality which states that the total area of two distinct surfaces conformal to an Euclidean disk with Gaussian curvature less than and the same conformal factor on the boundary must be at least pi In other words the areas of these surfaces must cover the whole unit sphere after a proper rearrangement We apply the Sphere Covering Inequality to show the best constant of a MoserTrudinger type inequality Other applications of this inequality include the classification of certain Onsager vortices on the sphere the radially symmetry of solutions to Gaussian curvature equation on the plane classification of solutions for mean field equations on flat tori and the standard sphere etc and lead to the resolution of several open problems in these areas The article is a joint work with Amir Moradifam from UC Riverside LCDS Seminar presents Changfeng Gui University of Texas at San Antonio

 Please join us for this workshop with Karl Wirth Associate Professor of Geology Macalester College Most faculty agree that critical thinking is an essential goal of an undergraduate education However despite some evidence that students make modest gains in critical thinking during college many employers report that recent graduates do not have the critical thinking skills needed for modern work And notwithstanding the access to information available to us using modern technologies a recent study found that students have a dismaying inability to tell fake news from real The goal of this workshop is to explore ways for being more explicit about what we mean by critical thinking and how we teach it Following a brief introduction to critical thinking several different instructional activities ranging in duration from short inclass assignments to multiweek projects will serve as examples of ways to explicitly teach the elements and standards of thinking Time for individual and group reflection will provide an opportunity for brainstorming activities to promote critical thinking in your own courses Please register for this event Sponsored by the ProblemSolving Initiative of the Brown Learning Collaborative Sheridan Center Teaching Critical Thinking in an Age of Alternative Facts and Fake News
 Hybrid Aesthetics Composing Digital and Physical Materials within Computational Design Creative technologies like digital fabrication led to the rise of the Maker Movement engendering grassroots innovation in education manufacturing and healthcare Today these creative technologies stand at a crossroads despite a significant rise in participation a deeper engagement with design and material is absent from traditional computeraided design workflows further complicated by the need to work with both physical and digital materials In this talk I will motivate the need for creative technologies to support the morphogenetic model of making a thinking and working style characteristic of how practitioners work with physical materials but difficult to access in digital design tools Within these tools material simulation and modeling have typically represented the physical world in a virtual space Across the domains of soft electronics illumination and metalworking Ill demonstrate how such computational techniques can be enacted within physical materials physical tools and physical practices to support morphogenetic workflows As a result this work lays a framework for composing new materials and technologies to foreground the existing knowledge and practices of traditional creative practitioners and generate new forms and aesthetics that can alter the trajectory of the Maker Movement towards a new Making Renaissance I will conclude with my vision for how ubiquitous computing can inform the design of cyberphysical studios ateliers guilds kitchens laboratories and makerspaces to sense the environment augment our motor perceptual and cognitive abilities and transform how creative practitioners adopt teach and appropriate new media practices Csar Torres is a PhD Candidate in Computer Science at the University of California Berkeley He is a member of the Hybrid Ecologies Lab advised by Eric Paulos and the Berkeley Center for New Media BCNM As a researcher Csar specializes in HumanComputer Interaction HCI synthesizing new media and craft theory into the software and hardware design of creative tangible user interfaces He has received multiple best paper awards at top venues within HCI and been supported through the NSF and AdobeGEM Consortium Graduate Fellowships and a Microsoft Research Dissertation Grant He recently joined the program committee for ACM Designing Interactive Systems DIS while previously serving on committees for ACM CHI and ACM TEI He holds a BA in Art Practice and a BS in Computer Science from Stanford University httpwwwceartocom Host Professor Daniel Ritchie Talk Cesar Torres UC Berkeley

 For more than three decades powerful drug trafficking factions have monopolized violence and replaced state authority with governance forms of their own in hundreds of favelas across Rio de Janeiros vast urban landscape In this talk based on three years of ethnographic fieldwork in Rio de Janeiro I focus on the emergence of gangs and their governance practices in Complexo da Mar the citys largest group of favelas On one hand I argue that the violent and repressive practices of Rio de Janeiros political institutions and public security apparatus pushed Mars residents away from preexisting forms of state governance to increasingly demand the services and authority provided by gangs On the other hand I argue that increasing competition between gangs for control of lucrative drug markets incentivized them to monopolize violence and consolidate their political authority within these communities Nicholas Barnes is a Postdoctoral Fellow in International and Public Affairs at the Watson Institute Nicholas Barnes The Origins of Gang Governance in Rio de Janeiro

 Samir Mitragotri PhD Hiller Professor of Bioengineering and Wyss Professor of Biologically Inspired Engineering at Harvard University will present a talk Understanding and Overcoming Biological Barriers for Drug Delivery Abstract Effective delivery of drugs is a major problem in todays healthcare At a fundamental level the challenge of drug delivery reflects the fact that the drug distribution in the body is limited by bodys natural metabolic processes and transport barriers These biological barriers while serving an important purpose of regulating bodys metabolic functions limit the drug dose that ultimately reaches the target site Accordingly many drugs fail to reach their full therapeutic potential Our research aims at developing a fundamental understanding of bodys key biological barriers such as skin intestinal epithelium and the immune system and utilizing this understanding to develop novel means to negotiate these barriers to deliver drugs Our research has led to the understanding of how transport properties of biological barriers can be modulated to deliver drugs in effective ways for the treatment of diseases such as diabetes and cancer among others I will present an overview of the lessons learned from our exploration of these biological barriers Engineering Seminar Biomedical Engineering

 Michael S Goodman Memorial Seminar Series CoSponsored by CVR Speaker Miyoung Kwon Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences University of Alabama at Birmingham Title Adaptive changes in the adult visual system following visual deprivation Abstract As our population ages a growing number of people must adapt to normal and pathological aging processes Approximately million Americans over the age of have severe visual impairments and the aging of society is expected to increase this number Thus understanding how the adult human brain deals with degraded sensory input is increasingly important In this talk I will present behavioral and brainimaging evidence suggesting that visual deprivation results in compensatory changes in the adult human visual system Here I will explore three major aspects of visual deprivation reduced image contrast reduced field of view and reduced spatial resolution In the first study I will discuss how the adult human brain adapts to prolonged exposure to contrast reduction In the second study I will address how the visual system adjusts to the loss of central vision that provides high acuity pattern vision Potential rehabilitation strategies to augment impaired vision will also be discussed In the third study I will address how the visual system achieves reliable pattern recognition when the sampling density of retinal neurons is severely limited Together the findings of these studies support the view that the human visual system continuously adapts and reorganizes to changes to sensory inputs This remarkable tolerance and adaptability to degraded visual input appears to improve detectability and discriminability of a given input signal Perception amp Action Seminar Series

 Adapting CNNs to the Dynamic D World Significant progress has been made on D image understanding by convolutional neural networks CNNs trained on huge amounts of labeled data However the goal of enabling intelligent machines to exist in and interact with the dynamic D world remains elusive To this end I argue that we need to build domain knowledge into CNNs and reduce their reliance on labeled data In this talk I will present my recent work in these directions including building classical principles of optical flow into the CNN architecture exploring selfsupervision signals to learn optical flow designing sparse lattice networks for point cloud processing All demonstrate the benefits of combining classical vision reasoning with deep learning Host Professor James Tompkin Talk Deqing Sun NVIDIA

 A longstanding problem in quantum topology is to find a function more precisely a qseries with integer coefficients such that its limiting values at primitive roots of unity yield invariants of Witten and ReshetikhinTuraev In other words such a function would be to manifolds what the Jones polynomial is to knots Somewhat surprisingly recent physics developments suggest that in order to solve this problem one must associate to a manifold not a single function qseries but rather a collection of functions Very recently based on both physical intuition and explicit computations it was suggested that these manifold invariants display modified modularity properties of various types and are related to number theoretic objects including mock and false theta functions and quantum modular forms This workshop will bring experts from the fields of topology physics and number theory together with the goal of combining knowledge and computational skills and furthering the understanding of the modular properties of the manifold invariants This workshop is fully funded by a Simons Foundation Targeted Grant to Institutes Modularity and manifolds

 In hegemonic legal discourse as well as dominant academic paradigms discussions of decolonization most often take former franchise colonies as their point of reference Postcolonial theory itself emerged from the study of the cultural legacy of colonialism and imperialism and how it endures after putative decolonization But what sort of decolonization is possible in settler colonial contexts In Patrick Wolfes theorization of settler colonialism he argued that this model of domination operates by the logic of elimination of the native because the acquisition of land is its central feature Based on enduring settlement settler colonialism is as Wolfe put it a structure not an event Thus in tending to settler colonialism as an ongoing structure of domination what decolonization must entail will differ than in franchise colonies or other colonial situations As such decolonization that includes a commitment to decoloniality should impact historical interpretation and by extension studies of race and indigeneity that challenge the logic of elimination J Khaulani Kauanui is Professor of American Studies and an affiliate faculty member in Anthropology at Wesleyan University where she serves as the current Chair of the American Studies Department and the current Director of the Center for the Americas Free and open to the public Sponsored by the Center for the Study of Race and Ethnicity in America the Center for Latin American and Caribbean Studies the Sawyer Seminar on Race and Indigeneity in the Americas J Khaulani Kauanui Decolonization in Settler Colonial Context Challenging the Logic of Elimination of the Native

 Michael S Goodman Memorial Seminar Series Social Cognitive Science Seminar Series Speaker Mascha vant Wout Brown University Department of Psychiatry and Human Behavior Title Changing emotions in social and nonsocial contexts with implications for psychiatry Abstract We all intuitively know that emotions influence the way we interact with the world around us regardless of whether these interactions are social or nonsocial in nature Although anger regret and fear can be helpful in certain situations they can also be debilitating and prevent us from reaching our goals as is the case in many mental disorders In this talk I will present some of my work on the role of emotions during social interactions as well as the role of emotional reactions in nonsocial contexts In particular I will discuss how the use of emotion regulation as well as noninvasive brain stimulation techniques can change the way we interact with others how we feel about decision outcomes and how it may reduce fear reactions In this work I make a link to psychiatry highlighting the effect of aberrations in social emotional processing on decisionrelated processes and discuss the potential for adjunctive brain stimulation to reduce fear Social Cognitive Science Seminar Series

 I will describe theoretical and experimental work in sensory systems neuroscience and neural engineering motivated in part by sensory prosthetics and other writein neural interfaces We use the rodent whisker system as a model for active sensing and provide closed loop optogenetic feedback to somatosensory cortex in behaving animals to investigate and manipulate their tactile exploration We find fast changes in motor behavior following real and artificial sensory stimulation highlighting the importance of thinking of natural sensation in an active loop not solely as a feedforward process and challenging a strict separation of sensory and motor brain area functions In parallel we design and test neurocontrol methods especially suited to underactuated situations where the number of neurons to be independently controlled exceeds the number of available inputs electrodes or optical fibers I will discuss fundamental mathematical limitations on neurocontrol given available hardware and argue that achieving robustness could motivate intentional model misspecification and reconsideration of the definitions of controllability In vivo testing in anesthetized mice shows qualitative agreement with theory but motivates adaptive approaches to address issues such as unit identification and drift Special Seminar Neurostimulation and control strategies for understanding and manipulating active touch

 Michael S Goodman Memorial Seminar Series Cognition Seminar Series Speaker Rose Cooper Boston College Title Brain networks supporting the reconstruction of past events Abstract Remembering specific past events known as episodic memory is a highly complex process and one which allows us to travel back in time and reexperience episodes in our lives These episodes are not stored and played back to us as we experienced them rather they are reconstructed Episodic reconstruction is thought to be facilitated by hippocampalcortical processes that rebuild the rich content and quality of past events Yet experimental paradigms often do not capture the variable components of memory experience As such limited progress has been made in identifying the unique contributions of brain regions and networks to the phenomenology of episodic memory I will discuss two functional neuroimaging projects that aimed to operationalize different aspects of episodic memory and uncover the unique contributions of brain regions and hippocampalcortical connections to the quality and content of remembered events We have shown that subjective and objective memory measures are behaviorally and neurally dissociable and have demonstrated how functional connections dynamically support the integration of different kinds of features that collectively form an episodic memory Cognition Seminar Series
