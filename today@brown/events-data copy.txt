  For centuries the sale and enslavement of men and women of African descent fueled a global economy The system of racial slavery relied upon ideas of racial difference that regulated social norms and conceptions of humanity and beauty The continued dominance of whiteness formed during this social system continues to devalue Black life and dehumanize men and women of African descent As well Black womens experiences are often left out of histories of slavery their contributions at the forefront of social movements forgotten 160  The work of 2018 Heimark Artist in Residence Jessica Hill examines the resilience of black womanhood today Her pieces explore the ways in which racial slavery created ideas about race and racial difference that continue to divide our society Her work references folktales created through the middle passage and the communities which enslaved people formed in the New World She creates intricate and beautiful patterns drawing from African symbols and design as well as the African American quilting tradition Using iconic references and images of slavery and resistance such as the whip the plantation chains and raised fists she visualizes the ways in which Black women have always fought various forms of incarceration seeking freedom for themselves and future generations By asking the viewer to reimagine familiar symbols the work of Jess Hill seeks to erode historical constructs which continue to dominate American society160160 Herstory Works by Jessica Hill

  Michael S Goodman 74 Memorial Seminar Series Speaker Ellie Pavlick Brown University160 Title Why should NLP care about linguistics160 Abstract In just the past few months a flurry of adversarial studies have pushed back on the apparent progress of neural networks with multiple analyses suggesting that deep models of text fail to capture even basic properties of language such as negation word order and compositionality Alongside this wave of negative results our field has stated ambitions to move beyond taskspecific models and toward general purpose word sentence and even document embeddings This is a tall order for the field of NLP and I argue marks a significant shift in the way we approach our research I will discuss what we can learn from the field of linguistics about the challenges of codifying all of language in a general purpose way Then more importantly I will discuss what we cannot learn from linguistics I will argue that the stateoftheart of NLP research is operating close to the limits of what we know about natural language semantics both within our field and outside it I will conclude with thoughts on why this opens opportunities for NLP to advance both technology and basic science as it relates to language and the implications for the way we should conduct empirical research                               LingLangLunch  Ellie Pavlick Brown University

  Neural networks as interacting particle systems Understanding global convergence of parameter optimization dynamics  The performance of neural networks on highdimensional data distributions suggests that it may be possible to parameterize a representation of a target highdimensional function with controllably small errors potentially outperforming standard interpolation methods We demonstrate both theoretically and numerically that this is indeed the case We map the parameters of a neural network to a system of particles relaxing with an interaction potential determined by the loss function This mapping gives rise to a deterministic partial differential equation that governs the parameter evolution under gradient descent dynamics We also show that in the limit that the number of parameters n is large the landscape of the meansquared error becomes convex and the representation error in the function scales link n1 In this limit we prove a dynamical variant of the universal approximation theorem showing that the optimal representation can be attained by stochastic gradient descent the algorithm ubiquitously used for parameter optimization in machine learning This conceptual framework can be leveraged to develop algorithms that accelerate optimization using nonlocal transport I will conclude by showing that using neuron birthdeath processes in parameter optimization guarantees global convergence and provides a substantial acceleration in practice Data Science Talk Grant Rotskoff

  LCDS Seminar  Monday February 11 2019  400pm  Room 108 170 Hope Street  Jonathan Jaquette Brandeis University  Title Computer assisted proofs of Wrights and Jones Conjectures Counting and discounting slowly oscillating periodic solutions to a delay differential equation  Abstract  A classical example of a nonlinear delay differential equations is Wrights equation yt alpha yt11yt considering  alpha gt0 and ytgt1 This talk discusses two conjectures associated with this equation Wrights conjecture which states that the origin is the global attractor for all  alpha in  0  pi 2  and Jones conjecture which states that there is a unique slowly oscillating periodic solution for  alpha gt pi  2  To prove Wrights conjecture our approach relies on a careful investigation of the neighborhood of the Hopf bifurcation occurring at alpha  pi 2  Using a rigorous numerical integrator we characterize slowly oscillating periodic solutions and calculate their stability proving Jones conjecture for  alpha in 19  60 and thereby all alpha19 We complete the proof of Jones conjecture using global optimization methods extended to treat infinite dimensional problems LCDS Seminar presents Jonathan Jaquette Brandeis University
  Title Big Bang vs Big Bounce  160  Abstract For over fifty years since the discovery of the cosmic microwave background the consensus view has been that the universe had a definite beginning known as the big bang In this talk I will review the standard inflationary paradigm and how it is supposed to explain the largescale structure of our universe We will then consider whether it is possible to replace the big bang with a big bounce discarding the idea of a beginning altogether and perhaps obtaining a more natural explanation of the largescale properties of the observable universe Colloquium  Anna Ijjas Harvard

  Abstract A longstanding goal in neuroscience is to achieve a complete understanding of the central nervous system from the brain as a whole all the way down to individual neurons and synapses A fundamental challenge in achieving this goal is bridging knowledge gaps impeded by the difficulty in integrating experimental measurements across different scales for example between computations in local circuits and communication across brain areas In the mammalian neocortex corticocortical connections formed by longrange projection neurons across different areas are essential for higher cognitive function I will present the development of new technologies that enable simultaneous recordings of identified longrange projection neurons across cortical areas Using the mouse tactile whisker sensorimotor system as a model I will describe the application of such methods for dissecting the role of longrange networks in the neocortex during sensoryguided decision making Dissecting LongRange Cortical Networks During Behavior

  What Spectre Means for Language Implementors  Until now CPU designers and computer scientists have assumed Vegas rules at the hardware level what happens in speculation stays in speculation Yet in the wake of the Spectre and Meltdown attacks it has become clear a new massive class of security vulnerabilities awaits us at the microarchitectural level because this assumption is simply false As language designers and implementors familiar with building towers of abstractions we have assumed that virtualization through emulation made the worlds below the Turing machine undetectable hidden behind a mathematically perfect mirror This talk will explore how we have now learned to see through that mirror into the very bizarre and alien world of microarchitectures illuminating a tiny world of astounding complexity that holds profound implications for language security  Ben L Titzer leads Googles WebAssembly team in Munich Before starting the WebAssembly project with Luke Wagner from Mozilla he led the team that built the TurboFan optimizing compiler which now powers JavaScript and WebAssembly in V8 He graduated with a BS from Purdue University in 2002 and MS and PhD from UCLA in 2004 and 2007 His interests include safe programming languages for systems programming compilers virtual machines nature and playing guitar  Host Professor Shriram Krishnamurthi Sysread Talk Ben Titzer Software Engineer Google

  Tyler Van Buren PhD Research Scholar at Princeton will present a talk Improving Performance of Unsteady Propulsors through Biological Inspiration  Abstract160Many species of aquatic life have evolved to swim fast and efficiently over long distances Some of these swimmers such as dolphin and tuna use propulsion methods where the principal thrust comes from oscillating a propulsive airfoillike surface such as a fluke or caudal fin Using these biological systems as inspiration we hope to develop propulsion systems with better maneuverability efficiency and speed  Here we will explore the physical mechanisms that govern the performanceespecially swimming speed and efficiencyof unsteady propulsive techniques inspired by biology We will see that scaling laws developed from basic principles can be used to model the performance of these types of propulsors Moreover we can use this model as a guide to achieve superior function for example by modifying the aerodynamic shape of the propulsors Through a better understanding of aquatic swimmers we can extend the performance of humanmade propulsors beyond the limits of biology  Bio160Dr Van Buren is a Research Scholar in the Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering Department at Princeton University working under Prof Alexander Smits He received his PhD from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute RPI under the advisement of Prof Michael Amitay Currently his research interests are in unsteady aerodynamicshydrodynamics bioinspired propulsion turbulent structure and stability and flow control devicesstrategies Learn more at wwwvanburenlabscom Fluids at Brown Division of Applied Mathematics Fluids and Thermal Sciences School of Engineering Joint Seminar Series

  Michael S Goodman 74 Memorial Colloquium160 Speaker Karolina Lempert University of Pennsylvania160 Title Understanding how people make decisions about the future160160 Abstract Just about every important choice we make involves consequences that extend beyond the here and now Existing models of such choices often called intertemporal choices are limited they both ignore the psychological mechanisms underlying those choices and they assume that peoples preferences are stable across time domains and contexts My research aims to uncover the cognitive mechanisms contributing to intertemporal choices by capturing and quantifying the disparate factors that impact these decisions My approach is interdisciplinary borrowing mathematical models and experimental paradigms from economics and methodologies from neuroscience to answer psychological questions My work has identified three novel factors that influence intertemporal choices which I will describe in this talk 1 individual differences in declarative memory 2 the recent history of offers in the task and 3 the nature of the intertemporal problem itself I will conclude by highlighting broader future directions that this research inspires Karolina Lempert University of Pennsylvania

  MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY ARE INVITED to attend this public lecture The equations of general relativity Einsteins field equations are among the most complicated partial differential equations in mathematical physics These equations predict the existence of gravitational waves which are propagating disturbances in spacetime itself In 2016 the first direct observation of these waves from colliding black holes was reported on a historic discovery that led to last years Nobel Prize This discovery would not have been possible without intense interaction between physicists mathematicians and highperformance computing tools Indeed numerically solving Einsteins equations for the expected wave signal and the processing of gravitationalwave datasets was enabled by advances in algorithms numerical methods and access to large computing resources In this talk I will focus on the critical role all three played in making this historic discovery as well as summarizing current directions in computational relativity and gravitationalwave data science ABOUT THE SPEAKER Scott Field is an assistant professor of Mathematics at UMass Dartmouth and a codirector of the data science program Before joining UMass Dartmouth he was a research associate in the numerical relativity group at Cornell University and a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Maryland In 2011 he completed his PhD at Brown University His research interests include the design and implementation of efficient numerical algorithms for scientific computing and data analysis with applications to general relativity gravitational waves and the analysis of data recorded by the Laser Interferometer GravitationalWave Observatory LIGO His work has been funded by NSF and the National Institute of Aerospace This event is free and open to the public Limited seating Please register to reserve a seat Hosted by the Institute for Computational and Experimental Research in Mathematics ICERM Doors open at 6PM and lecture will begin at 630PM ICERM Public Lecture Discovering Black Holes and Gravitational Waves Algorithms and Simulation

  Optimizing the Automated Programming Stack  The scale and pervasiveness of modern software poses a challenge for programmers software reliability is more important than ever but the complexity of computer systems continues to grow Automated programming tools are powerful weapons for programmers to tackle this challenge verifiers that check software correctness and synthesizers that generate new correctbyconstruction programs These tools are most effective when they apply domainspecific optimizations but doing so today requires considerable formal methods expertise  In this talk I present a new applicationdriven approach to optimizing the automated programming stack underpinning modern domainspecific tools I will demonstrate the importance of programming tools in the context of memory consistency models which define the behavior of multiprocessor CPUs and whose subtleties often elude even experts Our new tool MemSynth automatically synthesizes formal descriptions of memory consistency models from examples of CPU behavior We have used MemSynth to synthesize descriptions of the x86 and PowerPC memory models each of which previously required personyears of effort to describe by hand and found several ambiguities and underspecifications in both architectures I will then present symbolic profiling a new technique we designed and implemented to help people identify the scalability bottlenecks in automated programming tools These tools use symbolic evaluation which evaluates all paths through a program and is an execution model that defies both human intuition and standard profiling techniques Symbolic profiling diagnoses scalability bottlenecks using a novel performance model for symbolic evaluation that accounts for allpaths execution We have used symbolic profiling to find and fix performance issues in 8 stateoftheart automated tools improving their scalability by orders of magnitude and our techniques have been adopted in industry Finally I will give a sense of the importance of future applicationdriven optimizations to the automated programming stack with applications that inspire improvements to the stack and in turn beget even more powerful automated tools  James Bornholt is a PhD candidate in the Paul G Allen School of Computer Science amp Engineering at the University of Washington advised by Emina Torlak Dan Grossman and Luis Ceze His research interests are in programming languages and formal methods with a focus on automated program verification and synthesis His work has received an ACM SIGPLAN Research Highlight two IEEE Micro Top Picks selections an OSDI best paper award and a Facebook PhD fellowship  Host Shriram Krishnamurthi Talk James Bornholt University of  Washington

  Theory and Practice in Machine Learning and Computer Vision Feb 18  22 2019 Recent advances in machine learning have had a profound impact on computer vision Simultaneously success in computer vision applications has rapidly increased our understanding of some machine learning techniques especially their applicability This workshop will bring together researchers who are building a stronger theoretical understanding of the foundations of machine learning with computer vision researchers who are advancing our understanding of machine learning in practice Much of the recent growth in the use of machine learning in computer vision has been spurred by advances in deep neural networks At the same time new advances in other areas of machine learning including reinforcement learning generative models and optimization methods hold great promise for future impact These raise important fundamental questions such as understanding what influences the ability of learning algorithms to generalize understanding what causes optimization in learning to converge to effective solutions and understanding how to make optimization more efficient The workshop will include machine learning researchers who are addressing these foundational questions It will also include computer vision researchers who are applying machine learning to a host of problems such as visual categorization 3D reconstruction event and activity understanding and semantic segmentation Theory and Practice in Machine Learning and Computer Vision

  Watch webcast  Sarah Khan is a Postgraduate Associate at the Yale MacMillan Center Her research interests lie in gender and the political economy of development with a regional specialization in South Asia  In this paper Khan develops and tests a theory of how gender inequality within the household is reproduced in the political sphere and undermines prospects for womens substantive representation Drawing on an original facetoface survey conducted in 800 households in the Faisalabad district of Pakistan she shows that men and women within the same household prioritize systematically different public goods and services based on the contextspecific division of household labor Using a novel behavioral measure of political communication I demonstrate that women attach a lower value to their distinctive preferences than men and are less willing to communicate these preferences to political representatives The gendered asymmetry in preference assertion has implications for democratic theories of representation it suggests that the link between political participation and substantive representation may be undermined by gender inequality within the household  Sarahs research interests lie at the intersection of gender and comparative politics with a regional specialization in South Asia In her work she explores gender gaps in political preferences and the barriers to womens participation and substantive representation in Pakistan In another strand of research she explores questions related to the prevention of violence against women Her research has been generously supported by grants from the American Institute of Pakistan Studies the Abdul Jameel Poverty Action Lab JPAL Governance Initiative and the National Science Foundation  South Asia Seminar Sarah Khan  Personal is Political Gendered Preference Expression in Pakistan

  The Network is the Computer Running Distributed Services on  Programmable Switches  Historically the conventional wisdom has been that networks should  offer fixed functionality for forwarding packets and little else This  appears to be changing as a new breed of programmable switches match  the speed of fixed function devices This trend raises the question  What services could and should sit in the forwarding plane  In this talk we explore how a programmable forwarding plane can  naturally accelerate the fundamental building blocks of distributed  systems We identify and discuss three key issues for network  acceleration i How do we actually program network devices What are  the abstractions and limitations ii What is the right architecture  these networkeddistributed systems iii Given that we are asking  the network to do so much more work how can we be sure that it is  implemented correctly Our results show how we can build  provablycorrect distributed systems that provide ordersofmagnitude  performance improvements over softwarebased alternatives  Robert Soul is an associate professor at the Universit della  Svizzera italiana USI and a Research Scientist at Barefoot Networks  His research interests are in distributed systems networking and  applied programming languages Prior to joining USI he was a  postdoctoral associate at Cornell University He received his PhD  from New York University in 2012 and his BA from Brown University in  1999 For two years he was a research coop in the Data Intensive  Systems and Analytics Group at IBM T J Watson Research Center He is  the recipient of an IBM Invention Plateau Award a Google Faculty  Research Award and Best Paper Awards at ACM DEBS 2012 and USENIX NSDI  2018  Host Professor Shriram Krishnamurthi Talk Robert Soule Faculty of Informatics at Universita della Svizzera Italiana USI and Research Scientist at Barefoot Networks

  LCDS Seminar  Monday February 25 2019  400pm  Room 108 170 Hope Street  Thomas Michael Harvard  Title Bridging time and length scales in filamentous protein selfassembly  Abstract Filamentous protein selfassembly is a process in which dispersed proteins assemble spontaneously to form ordered elongated structures This phenomenon is an essential characteristic of life finds widespread use in numerous nanotechnological applications but is also at the heart of pathologies of many types including Parkinsons and Alzheimers diseases To exploit protein selfassembly for nanotechnology or curtail it for medical purposes it is necessary to quantify the fundamental principles that control the way dispersed molecules assemble into these ordered structures The fundamental challenge in establishing such an understanding in a rigorous manner is the disparate nature of the spatial and temporal scales involved In this talk I demonstrate how we can address this challenge by bringing the power of physical methods to protein selfassembly to connect microscopic mechanisms with macroscopic observations of such phenomena In a first part of the talk I discuss a unified theory of the kinetics of filamentous protein assembly and show how these results reveal simple rate laws that provide the basis for interpreting experimental data in terms of specific mechanisms controlling the proliferation of fibrils I will then discuss how the resulting methods can guide us in the development of rational strategies for controlling aberrant protein aggregation in time and space I will bring together protein aggregation kinetics with optimal control theory to determine explicit optimal administration protocols of drugs that inhibit specific molecular events during the aggregation process I will also introduce ideas from liquidliquid phase separation to investigate how liquid cellular compartments could be implicated in spatially regulating protein aggregation LCDS Seminar presents Thomas Michael Harvard University
  Feynmans last adventure in integrability    2018 marked the 100th anniversary of the birth and 30 years since the passing of Richard Feynman a brilliantly creative physicist and a legendary personality in science and society at large During the last year of his life at Caltech Feynman became fascinated by integrable models and his involvement and enthusiasm inspired and motivated both experts and novices in the field I will attempt to give a glimpse into Feynmans thinking and personality through the lens of personal memories and mementos from that last year Colloquium  Alexios Polychronakos CUNY
  Professor Konstantinos Danas Solid Mechanics Laboratory at CNRS Ecole Polytechnique will present a talk Microstructured Magnetorheological Elastomers and Instabilities  Abstract Magnetorheological elastomers MREs are ferromagnetic particle impregnated rubbers whose mechanical properties are altered by the application of external magnetic fields In addition these composite materials can deform at very large strains due to the presence of the soft polymeric matrix without fracturing From an unconventional point of view a remarkable property of these materials is that while they can become unstable by combined magnetomechanical loading their response is well controlled in the postinstability regime This in turn allows us to try to operate these materials in this critically stable region These instabilities can lead to extreme responses such as wrinkles for haptic applications actively controlled stiffness for cellgrowth and acoustic properties with only marginal changes in the externally applied magnetic fields Unlike the current modeling of hierarchical composites MREs require the development of finitestrain coupled nonlinear magnetomechanical models in order to tailor the desired macroscopic instability response at finite strains As a proof of concept we study experimentally and theoretically the stability and postbifurcation of a nonlinear magnetoelastic filmsubstrate block in order to obtain active control of surface roughness The nonintuitive interplay between magnetic field and elastic deformation owes to material and geometry selection namely a ferromagnetic particle composite film bonded on a compliant passive foundation Cooperation of two otherwise independent loading mechanismsmechanical precompression and magnetic fieldallows to bring the structure near a marginally stable state and then destabilize it with either magnetic or mechanical fields We demonstrate for the first time that the critical magnetic field is a decreasing function of precompression and vice versa The experimental results are then probed successfully with fullfield finite element simulations at large strains and magnetic fields The magnetoelastic coupling allows for the reversible onoff control of surface wrinkling under adjustable critical magnetic and mechanical fields In this view this study constitutes a first step towards realistic active haptic and morphing devices Novel auxetic and chiral architected MREs are also proposed as potential candidates for future work Engineering Seminar Joint MaterialsSolid Mechanics

  Building systems that can understand visual concepts and describe them coherently in natural language is fundamental to artificial intelligence Advances in machine learning have had profound impact on computer vision and natural language processing There has been interesting progress in recent years at the intersection of these two fields producing systems that describe eg caption images and videos captured by personal cameras in ordinary scenes and street views Much work remains in this and a host of related problems including that of building natural language descriptions of commercial overhead imagery and videos where automation is greatly needed If we were to attempt to manually exploit the commercial satellite imagery we expect to have over the next 20 years we would need eight million imagery analysts Robert Cardillo NGA Director GEOINT Symposium 2017 This workshop brings together researchers in machine learning computer vision natural language processing to discuss best practices in machine generated descriptions for both consumer and overhead imagery and videos Participants will identify challenges and recommend future research topics Image Description for Consumer and Overhead Imagery Feb 25  26 2019

  SelfSupervised Machine Learning for Interdisciplinary Data Science  Learning to reason and understand the worlds knowledge is a fundamental problem in Data Science While it is always hypothesized that the machine learning models should be generalizable and flexible in practice most of the progress is still in classic supervised machine learning settings that require a large amount of annotated training data and heuristic objectives  With the vast amount of data available in digital form now is a good opportunity to move beyond traditional supervised learning methods The core research question that I will address in this talk is the following how can we design selfsupervised deep learning methods to operate over rich representations In this talk I will describe some examples of my work in advancing the stateofthearts in methods of deep reinforcement learning for interdisciplinary data science including 1 Reinforced CoTraining a new semisupervised text classification framework that is driven by a reinforced performancedriven data selection policy agent  2 AREL a selfadaptive inverse reinforcement learning agent for visual storytelling and 3 DeepPath an explainable pathbased reasoning agent for inferring unknown facts on knowledge graphs I will conclude this talk by describing my other research interests in building sociallyresponsible learning algorithms and my future research plans in the interdisciplinary field of data science  William Wang is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science at the University of California Santa Barbara He is also the Glen and Susanne Culler Chair in Computer Science He received his PhD from School of Computer Science Carnegie Mellon University in 2016 He has broad interests in machine learning approaches to data science including natural language processing statistical relational learning information extraction computational social science dialogue and vision He directs UCSBs NLP Group nlpcsucsbedu in two years UCSB advanced in the NLP area from an undefined ranking position to top 3 in 2018 according to CSRankingsorg He has published more than 60 papers at leading NLPAIML conferences and journals and received best paper awards or nominations at ASRU 2013 CIKM 2013 and EMNLP 2015 a DARPA Young Faculty Award Class of 2018 two IBM Faculty Awards in 2017 and 2018 a Facebook Research Award in 2018 an Adobe Research Award in 2018 and the Richard King Mellon Presidential Fellowship in 2011 He served as an Area Chair for NAACL ACL EMNLP and AAAI He is an alumnus of Columbia University Yahoo Labs Microsoft Research Redmond and University of Southern California In addition to research William enjoys writing scientific articles that impact the broader online community his microblog Weibo has 111000 followers and more than 2000000 views each month His work and opinions frequently appear at major international media outlets such as Wired VICE Fast Company NASDAQ The Next Web The Brookings Institution Lawcom and Mental Floss  Host Professor Bjorn Sandstede Talk William Wang University of California Santa Barbara

  Since the 1980s Emergency Rooms ERs in the US have been solidified as the most democratic albeit most expensive entry point to healthcare They have also recently been increasingly defended as necessary features of public health budgets especially in urban centers Few studies however have examined this shift towards an era of emergency medicine from the era of hospitals that preceded it In fact as this talk will discuss citizen calls to democratize and universalize health in 1965 centered on building a hospital in every neighborhood Looking to riot remediation plans created by the County of Los Angeles and black physician activists of the National Medical Association NMA after the 1965 Watts Uprisings this talk will discuss how plans to democratize health involved constructing a new Medical Center called KingDrew and opened in 1972 that abolished the emergency waiting room and sought to use its functions as an antipoverty program to integrate Black communities into mainstream society I argue however innovation in emergency medical systems arising out of the Watts Uprisings coupled with the emergence of a new service economy shifted citizen attention away from publiclyfunded hospitals to publiclyfunded emergency departments Nic Ramos  From A Hospital in Every Neighborhood to an Emergency Room in Every Region Democratizing Displacing and Distributing Care After the Age of Hospitals

  Data Discovery Unleashing the Value of Data  Organizations use only a small portion of all data they own Consequently most of the potential value is untapped This happens because their analysts suffer a data discovery problem when solving a task that requires data analysts spend more time finding the relevant data than solving the task at hand The core problem is that there is not adequate infrastructure to support the many different discovery problems organizations face Hence finding data remains largely a manual and timeconsuming process  In this talk Ill present Aurum a system that radically changes how users interact with their organizationss data With Aurum users can solve discovery problems in minutes instead of weeks To achieve this Aurum has three novel features 1 it makes data discovery programmable so users can solve many different discovery problems by writing different programs 2 it solves data discovery queries fast so users can solve their problems in minutes instead of weeks 3 it scales to large amounts of data so no relevant data is left behind In addition Ill explain how Aurum handles not only structured data such as tables in databases data lakes and spreadsheets but also unstructured data such as PDF files word documents and even conversations from Slack channels  Ill conclude with a vision for how to make data easier to work with and to program a key ingredient needed to exploit all data available in organizations and enable new applications  In my research I build highperformance systems for discovering preparing and processing data I often use techniques from data management statistics and machine learning At MIT I work with professors Sam Madden and Mike Stonebraker Before MIT I completed my PhD at Imperial College London with Peter Pietzuch  Host Professor Stan Zdonik Talk Raul Castro Fernandez MIT

  Prof Raquel Assis  Assistant Professor of Biology  Penn State Eberly College of Science  Evolution of Genomic Rearrangements in Animals and Plants  Notorious for their roles in human disease genomic rearrangements are also major drivers of evolutionary change To understand this process my lab designs and applies computational and statistical approaches to infer the evolutionary outcomes and adaptive significance of genomic rearrangements from patterns in genomic and transcriptomic data within and among closely related species In this talk I will focus on our studies of two opposing classes of rearrangements gene duplications and deletions First I will summarize our research in utilizing multitissue gene expression profiles to identify evolutionary outcomes of gene duplication events in Drosophila mammals and grasses Of particular interest is that our findings suggest that the evolution of duplicate genes may be fueled by natural selection on male reproductive phenotypes in all three taxonomic groups Next I will describe how we explicitly tested this hypothesis in Drosophila by quantifying natural selection in duplicate genes and interrogating its types timing and targets Through these analyses we reveal that natural selection is indeed a key player in the evolution of Drosophila duplicate genes acts rapidly and in a regionspecific manner and may underlie the origin of male reproductive phenotypes Last I will discuss our recent work in assessing evolutionary outcomes of gene deletions in Drosophila Specifically we show that deletions typically result in losses of unique rather than redundant genes Moreover we uncover biases toward preferential deletion of carcassexpressed genes and retention of ovaryexpressed genes possibly implicating gene deletion in the evolution of female reproductive phenotypes in Drosophila Together these studies highlight the evolutionary importance of both gene duplications and deletions indicating that they may act in concert to promote adaptation of male and female reproductive phenotypes  Hosted by Prof Emilia HuertaSanchez Evolution of Genomic Rearrangements in Animals and Plants

  Frederike Petzschner University of Zurich    Psychiatry faces major challenges its nosology is agnostic about mechanisms  lacks predictive validity and leads to trialanderror treatment  Strikingly neuroscientific advances have hardly affected nosology or  clinical practice One response to this disconnect is computational  psychiatry with its emerging focus on clinical applications One strategy  for computational psychiatry is to learn from internal medicine where  mechanistic frameworks for differential diagnosis enable targeted treatment  decisions for individual patients In my talk I will 1 outline  computational approaches to improve treatment prediction in OCD and 2  provide a framework to explain and test maladaptive brainbody interactions   in particular cardioception  which may become increasingly relevant for  differential diagnosis in psychosomatic disorders Computational Psychiatry and Computational Psychosomatics

  Limin Peng PhD  Professor Biostatistics and Bioinformatics  Rollins School of Public Health  Emory University  Title Quantile Regression Modeling of Latent Trajectory Features with Longitudinal Data  Quantile regression has demonstrated promising utility in longitudinal data analysis Existing work is primarily focused on modeling crosssectional outcomes while outcome trajectories often carry more substantive information in practice In this work we develop a trajectory quantile regression framework that is designed to robustly and flexibly investigate how latent individual trajectory features are related to observed subject characteristics The proposed models are built under multilevel modeling with usual parametric assumptions lifted or relaxed We derive our estimation procedure by novelly transforming the problem at hand to quantile regression with perturbed responses and adapting the bias correction technique for handling covariate measurement errors We establish desirable asymptotic properties of the proposed estimator including uniform consistency and weak convergence Extensive simulation studies confirm the validity of the proposed method as well as its robustness An application to the DURABLE trial uncovers sensible scientific findings and illustrates the practical value of our proposals Brown Statistics C V Starr Lecture featuring Limin Peng PhD Emory University
  LCDS Seminar  Monday March 4 2019  400 pm  Room 108 170 Hope Street  Changfeng Gui University of Texas at San Antonio  Title The Sphere Covering Inequality and its Applications  AbstractIn this talk we introduce a new geometric inequality the Sphere Covering Inequality which states that the total area of two distinct surfaces conformal to an Euclidean disk with Gaussian curvature less than 1 and the same conformal factor on the boundary must be at least 4 pi In other words the areas of these surfaces must cover the whole unit sphere after a proper rearrangement We apply the Sphere Covering Inequality to show the best constant of a MoserTrudinger type inequality Other applications of this inequality include the classification of certain Onsager vortices on the sphere the radially symmetry of solutions to Gaussian curvature equation on the plane classification of solutions for mean field equations on flat tori and the standard sphere etc and lead to the resolution of several open problems in these areas The article is a joint work with Amir Moradifam from UC Riverside LCDS Seminar presents Changfeng Gui University of Texas at San Antonio

  Hybrid Aesthetics  Composing Digital and Physical Materials within Computational Design  Creative technologies like digital fabrication led to the rise of the Maker Movement engendering grassroots innovation in education manufacturing and healthcare Today these creative technologies stand at a crossroads  despite a significant rise in participation a deeper engagement with design and material is absent from traditional computeraided design workflows further complicated by the need to work with both physical and digital materials  In this talk I will motivate the need for creative technologies to support the morphogenetic model of making a thinking and working style characteristic of how practitioners work with physical materials but difficult to access in digital design tools Within these tools material simulation and modeling have typically represented the physical world in a virtual space Across the domains of soft electronics illumination and metalworking Ill demonstrate how such computational techniques can be enacted within physical materials physical tools and physical practices to support morphogenetic workflows As a result this work lays a framework for composing new materials and technologies to foreground the existing knowledge and practices of traditional creative practitioners and generate new forms and aesthetics that can alter the trajectory of the Maker Movement towards a new Making Renaissance  I will conclude with my vision for how ubiquitous computing can inform the design of cyberphysical studios ateliers guilds kitchens laboratories and makerspaces to sense the environment augment our motor perceptual and cognitive abilities and transform how creative practitioners adopt teach and appropriate new media practices  Csar Torres is a PhD Candidate in Computer Science at the University of California Berkeley He is a member of the Hybrid Ecologies Lab advised by Eric Paulos and the Berkeley Center for New Media BCNM As a researcher Csar specializes in HumanComputer Interaction HCI synthesizing new media and craft theory into the software and hardware design of creative tangible user interfaces He has received multiple best paper awards at top venues within HCI and been supported through the NSF and AdobeGEM Consortium Graduate Fellowships and a Microsoft Research Dissertation Grant He recently joined the program committee for ACM Designing Interactive Systems DIS while previously serving on committees for ACM CHI and ACM TEI He holds a BA in Art Practice and a BS in Computer Science from Stanford University  httpwwwceartocom  Host Professor Daniel Ritchie Talk Cesar Torres UC Berkeley

  For more than three decades powerful drug trafficking factions have monopolized violence and replaced state authority with governance forms of their own in hundreds of favelas across Rio de Janeiros vast urban landscape In this talk based on three years of ethnographic fieldwork in Rio de Janeiro I focus on the emergence of gangs and their governance practices in Complexo da Mar the citys largest group of favelas On one hand I argue that the violent and repressive practices of Rio de Janeiros political institutions and public security apparatus pushed Mars residents away from preexisting forms of state governance to increasingly demand the services and authority provided by gangs On the other hand I argue that increasing competition between gangs for control of lucrative drug markets incentivized them to monopolize violence and consolidate their political authority within these communities  Nicholas Barnes is a Postdoctoral Fellow in International and Public Affairs at the Watson Institute Nicholas Barnes  The Origins of Gang Governance in Rio de Janeiro

  Samir Mitragotri PhD Hiller Professor of Bioengineering and Wyss Professor of Biologically Inspired Engineering at Harvard University will present a talk Understanding and Overcoming Biological Barriers for Drug Delivery  Abstract Effective delivery of drugs is a major problem in todays healthcare At a fundamental level the challenge of drug delivery reflects the fact that the drug distribution in the body is limited by bodys natural metabolic processes and transport barriers These biological barriers while serving an important purpose of regulating bodys metabolic functions limit the drug dose that ultimately reaches the target site Accordingly many drugs fail to reach their full therapeutic potential Our research aims at developing a fundamental understanding of bodys key biological barriers such as skin intestinal epithelium and the immune system and utilizing this understanding to develop novel means to negotiate these barriers to deliver drugs Our research has led to the understanding of how transport properties of biological barriers can be modulated to deliver drugs in effective ways for the treatment of diseases such as diabetes and cancer among others I will present an overview of the lessons learned from our exploration of these biological barriers Engineering Seminar Biomedical Engineering

  Michael S Goodman 74 Memorial Seminar Series CoSponsored by CVR160 Speaker Miyoung Kwon Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences University of Alabama at Birmingham160 Title Adaptive changes in the adult visual system following visual deprivation160 Abstract As our population ages a growing number of people must adapt to normal and pathological aging processes Approximately 65 million Americans over the age of 65 have severe visual impairments and the aging of society is expected to increase this number Thus understanding how the adult human brain deals with degraded sensory input is increasingly important In this talk I will present behavioral and brainimaging evidence suggesting that visual deprivation results in compensatory changes in the adult human visual system Here I will explore three major aspects of visual deprivation reduced image contrast reduced field of view and reduced spatial resolution In the first study I will discuss how the adult human brain adapts to prolonged exposure to contrast reduction In the second study I will address how the visual system adjusts to the loss of central vision that provides high acuity pattern vision Potential rehabilitation strategies to augment impaired vision will also be discussed In the third study I will address how the visual system achieves reliable pattern recognition when the sampling density of retinal neurons is severely limited Together the findings of these studies support the view that the human visual system continuously adapts and reorganizes to changes to sensory inputs This remarkable tolerance and adaptability to degraded visual input appears to improve detectability and discriminability of a given input signal Perception amp Action Seminar Series

  Adapting CNNs to the Dynamic 3D World  Significant progress has been made on 2D image understanding by convolutional neural networks CNNs trained on huge amounts of labeled data However the goal of enabling intelligent machines to exist in and interact with the dynamic 3D world remains elusive To this end I argue that we need to build domain knowledge into CNNs and reduce their reliance on labeled data In this talk I will present my recent work in these directions including 1 building classical principles of optical flow into the CNN architecture 2 exploring selfsupervision signals to learn optical flow 3 designing sparse lattice networks for point cloud processing All demonstrate the benefits of combining classical vision reasoning with deep learning    Host Professor James Tompkin Talk Deqing Sun NVIDIA

  A longstanding problem in quantum topology is to find a function more precisely a qseries with integer coefficients such that its limiting values at primitive roots of unity yield invariants of Witten and ReshetikhinTuraev In other words such a function would be to 3manifolds what the Jones polynomial is to knots Somewhat surprisingly recent physics developments suggest that in order to solve this problem one must associate to a 3manifold not a single function qseries but rather a collection of functions Very recently based on both physical intuition and explicit computations it was suggested that these 3manifold invariants display modified modularity properties of various types and are related to number theoretic objects including mock and false theta functions and quantum modular forms This workshop will bring experts from the fields of topology physics and number theory together with the goal of combining knowledge and computational skills and furthering the understanding of the modular properties of the 3manifold invariants This workshop is fully funded by a Simons Foundation Targeted Grant to Institutes Modularity and 3manifolds

  In hegemonic legal discourse as well as dominant academic paradigms discussions of decolonization most often take former franchise colonies as their point of reference Postcolonial theory itself emerged from the study of the cultural legacy of colonialism and imperialism and how it endures after putative decolonization But what sort of decolonization is possible in settler colonial contexts In Patrick Wolfes theorization of settler colonialism he argued that this model of domination operates by the logic of elimination of the native because the acquisition of land is its central feature Based on enduring settlement settler colonialism is  as Wolfe put it  a structure not an event Thus in tending to settler colonialism as an ongoing structure of domination what decolonization must entail will differ than in franchise colonies or other colonial situations As such decolonization that includes a commitment to decoloniality should impact historical interpretation and by extension studies of race and indigeneity that challenge the logic of elimination  J Khaulani Kauanui is Professor of American Studies and an affiliate faculty member in Anthropology at Wesleyan University where she serves as the current Chair of the American Studies Department and the current Director of the Center for the Americas  Free and open to the public160  Sponsored by the Center for the Study of Race and Ethnicity in America the Center for Latin American and Caribbean Studies the Sawyer Seminar on Race and Indigeneity in the Americas J Khaulani Kauanui Decolonization in Settler Colonial Context Challenging the Logic of Elimination of the Native

  Michael S Goodman 74 Memorial Seminar Series160 Cognition Seminar Series160 Speaker Rose Cooper Boston College160 Title Brain networks supporting the reconstruction of past events160 Abstract160 Remembering specific past events known as episodic memory is a highly complex process and one which allows us to travel back in time and reexperience episodes in our lives These episodes are not stored and played back to us as we experienced them rather they are reconstructed Episodic reconstruction is thought to be facilitated by hippocampalcortical processes that rebuild the rich content and quality of past events Yet experimental paradigms often do not capture the variable components of memory experience As such limited progress has been made in identifying the unique contributions of brain regions and networks to the phenomenology of episodic memory I will discuss two functional neuroimaging projects that aimed to 1 operationalize different aspects of episodic memory and 2 uncover the unique contributions of brain regions and hippocampalcortical connections to the quality and content of remembered events We have shown that subjective and objective memory measures are behaviorally and neurally dissociable and have demonstrated how functional connections dynamically support the integration of different kinds of features that collectively form an episodic memory Cognition Seminar Series
