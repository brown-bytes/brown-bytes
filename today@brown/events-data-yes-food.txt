today in the red  the politics of public debt    zs  fia barta  will discuss her new book in the red  the politics of public debt accumulation in developed countries   why do rich countries flirt with fiscal disaster  between the 1970s and the 2000s  during times of peace and prosperity  affluent countries   like belgium  greece  italy  and japan   accumulated so much debt that they became vulnerable and exposed themselves to the risk of default  in the past three decades  an extensive scholarly consensus emerged that these problems were created by fiscal indiscipline  the lack of sufficient concern for budgetary constraints from policy makers as they try to please voters  this approach formed the foundation for the fiscal surveillance system that attempted to bring borrowing in european countries under control via a set of fiscal rules  in the red demonstrates that the problem of sustained  large scale debt accumulation is an adjustment issue rather than a governance failure  irrespective of whether the original impetus for borrowing arose from exogenous changes or irresponsible decision making  policy makers invariably initiate spending cuts and or tax increases when debt grows at an alarming rate for several years in a row  zs  fia barta argues that explaining why some countries accumulate substantial amounts of debt for decades hinges on understanding the conditions required to allow policy makers to successfully put into place painful adjustment measures  lunch will be provided
